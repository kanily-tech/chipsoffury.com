### And with this we have a blog!

Just finished moving this site to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It has been a delight to use. 
Intuitive, easy to learn and flexible - love it!

For those of you who don't know what I am talking about, 11ty is a static site generator. It let's me write this post
in markdown, and it converts it to HTML and also applies the boilerplate styles and containers around it that help
with the look and feel of this site.
