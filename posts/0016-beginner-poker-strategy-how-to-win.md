You know the rules. You've played a few hands with friends, maybe jumped into some low-stakes games online. And yet your
chip stack keeps shrinking. You're making reasonable decisions - or so it feels - but somehow the players who seem to be
gambling recklessly keep winning pots while you're left wondering what you're doing wrong.

Knowing poker rules and knowing poker strategy are completely different things. You can follow every rule perfectly and
still hemorrhage money if you don't understand *why* winning players make certain decisions. Most beginners stay stuck
in that gap - "I know how to play" vs "I know how to win" - for months or years.

What follows is a structured way to think through every hand of Texas Hold'em, from the moment you look at your cards to
the final bet. You'll also find the core math concepts (simplified), the psychological reads that actually matter at
beginner tables, and the discipline habits that separate players who profit from players who donate.

Fair warning: some of this advice will feel boring. Fold more. Play fewer hands. Skip the flashy bluffs. That's not
sexy, but it's what works. Professional players fold around 80% of their starting hands. If you're mostly folding,
you're doing it right. The players who lose money are the ones who can't resist "just seeing one more flop."

## Before You Play - The Beginner Mindset

### Why Most Beginners Lose (And How to Avoid It)

Ask any experienced player what separates winners from losers at low-stakes tables, and you'll hear the same patterns
over and over:

**They play too many hands.** New players look at their two cards and want to gamble. A-4? "Well, it's an ace." K-7
suited? "Could make a flush." 9-6? "Might hit something." This thinking bleeds money. In poker, only about 20% of
starting hands are profitable long-term winners. That means folding 80% of what you're dealt isn't pessimistic - it's
correct.

**They call when they should fold or raise.** Beginners love calling. It feels safe - you're still in the hand without
committing too much. But calling is often the worst option. When you bet or raise, you can win two ways: your opponent
folds, or you make the best hand. When you call, you can only win one way. This single habit - calling too much - is
probably costing you more money than any other leak.

**They ignore position.** Where you sit relative to the dealer button might seem like a minor detail. It's not. Acting
last gives you information about what everyone else did before you have to decide. Acting first means you're flying
blind. Good players play 2-3x more hands from late position than early position. Beginners play the same hands
everywhere and wonder why they keep getting outmaneuvered.

**They tilt after losing.** You make the right call, your opponent hits a miracle card on the river, and suddenly your
stack is halved. The temptation to "win it back" with aggressive, reckless play is overwhelming. This emotional spiral -
playing worse because you're upset about losing - destroys more [bankrolls](glossary:bankroll) than bad cards ever
could. The cards don't know you're frustrated. They don't owe you a win.

This guide addresses each of these weaknesses directly with tight, aggressive fundamentals and a structured approach to
every decision.

### The Three Pillars of Winning Poker: Math, Psychology, Discipline

Every winning poker player - from the weekend grinder to the World Series champion - relies on three interconnected
skills. You don't need to master all three immediately, but you need to know they exist and start building each one.

**Math: The Foundation You Can't Bluff Your Way Around**

Poker math sounds intimidating, but at the beginner level, you only need a handful of concepts:

- **Hand rankings:** Know instantly whether a flush beats a straight (it does) or whether two pair beats three of a
  kind (it doesn't). Confusion here costs you money.
- **Pot odds:** If the pot is $30 and you need to call $10, you're getting 3:1 odds. That means you need to win more
  than 25% of the time for the call to be profitable. If your draw only hits 20% of the time, fold.
- **Expected Value (EV):** This is the average result of a decision if you made it thousands of times. A simple
  formula: (% chance of winning × amount you'd win) minus (% chance of losing × amount you'd lose). Positive number =
  good decision. Negative number = bad decision. You don't need to calculate this at the table, but understanding the
  concept helps you recognize why certain plays are profitable and others aren't.

Here's a practical example: You have a flush draw (9 outs, roughly 35% chance to hit by the river). The pot
is $100 and your opponent bets $20. The pot is now $120, and you need to call $20 to stay in. You're
risking $20 to win $120 - that's 6:1 pot odds, meaning you only need to win about 14% of the time for calling to be
profitable. Your 35% chance crushes that threshold. Clear call.

**Psychology: Reading People, Not Minds**

Forget the Hollywood version of poker tells where someone's eye twitches and you know they're bluffing. At beginner
tables, psychology is simpler: categorize players and adjust.

Most players fall somewhere on two spectrums: tight to loose (how many hands they play) and passive to aggressive (how
they bet those hands). This creates four basic types:

- **Tight-aggressive (TAG):** Plays few hands, bets them hard. Respect their raises - they usually have it. This is the
  style you should aim for.
- **Loose-passive (calling station):** Plays many hands, rarely raises, hates folding. Don't bluff these players. Just
  bet your good hands for value - they'll call with worse.
- **Tight-passive (rock):** Plays few hands, rarely bets without [the nuts](glossary:nuts). Steal their blinds, but fold
  when they show aggression.
- **Loose-aggressive (maniac):** Plays many hands, bets and raises constantly. Tighten up and let them pay you off with
  your strong hands.

A quick tell that works at most tables: look at how someone stacks their chips. Messy, scattered stacks often indicate a
loose, gambling style. Neat, organized stacks suggest a tighter, more methodical player. Not foolproof, but a useful
first impression.

**Discipline: The Multiplier That Makes Everything Else Work**

You can know all the math and read every opponent perfectly, but without discipline, you'll still lose. Discipline
means:

- Folding a hand you want to play because the situation is wrong
- Walking away from a table when you're [tilting](glossary:tilt)
- Sticking to your [bankroll](glossary:bankroll) limits even when you're "sure" you can win it back
- Making the boring, correct play instead of the exciting, risky one

The best players aren't the ones who make brilliant plays - they're the ones who consistently avoid bad ones. Discipline
is the multiplier. Good math × good reads × poor discipline = losing player. Decent math × decent reads × strong
discipline = winning player.

---

### Setting Expectations: Variance, Luck & Long-Term Thinking

Here's something that frustrates every new player: you can make the perfect decision and still lose. You can get your
money in with pocket aces against pocket kings - an 80/20 favorite - and watch a king hit the board. That's not bad
play. That's variance.

**Variance is the gap between what should happen and what actually happens in the short term.** In any individual hand
or session, luck dominates. The player making terrible decisions can win. The player making perfect decisions can lose.
This is what makes poker feel unfair - and what keeps bad players coming back.

But here's what separates poker from pure gambling: over thousands of hands, luck evens out and skill takes over. The
math is relentless. If you consistently make decisions with positive expected value, you will profit in the long run.
Not might. Will. The question is whether you can survive the short-term swings without going broke or losing your mind.

**The psychological trap most beginners fall into:** They credit their wins to skill and blame their losses on bad luck.
Win a session? "I played great." Lose a session? "Couldn't catch a card." This mental pattern prevents improvement
because you never examine your actual mistakes.

A healthier framework: after every session, ask yourself "Did I make good decisions?" not "Did I win?" You can make
perfect decisions and lose. You can make terrible decisions and win. Judging your play by results is like judging a
weather forecaster by whether it rained today. Focus on the process.

**Practical advice for surviving variance:**

- **Play stakes you can afford to lose.** If losing a buy-in ruins your week, you're playing too high.
- **Zoom out your timeline.** Don't evaluate your play over one session. Look at trends over weeks or months.
- **Accept bad beats without spiraling.** When you lose with aces to a two-outer, acknowledge it sucks, then move on.
  The cards don't owe you anything.
- **Recognize when you're tilting.** If you catch yourself thinking "I deserve to win this one" or making revenge calls,
  stop playing. Your emotional state is costing you money.

The players who last in poker aren't necessarily the most talented - they're the ones who can handle losing with grace
and keep making correct decisions anyway.

## The Poker Basics You Must Master First

### Hand Rankings (Simple Memory Framework)

Here's the complete list from strongest to weakest. For a deeper breakdown with examples and tie-breaker rules, see
our [full hand rankings guide](/posts/poker-winning-hand-rankings/).

| Rank | Hand                | What It Looks Like                                             | How Often in Hold'em* |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | **Royal Flush**     | A-K-Q-J-10, all same suit                                      | 1 in 31,000 hands     |
| 2    | **Straight Flush**  | Five cards in sequence, same suit (e.g., 7-8-9-10-J of hearts) | 1 in 3,600            |
| 3    | **Four of a Kind**  | Four cards of same rank (e.g., four Kings)                     | 1 in 600              |
| 4    | **Full House**      | Three of a kind + a pair (e.g., three 8s and two Jacks)        | 1 in 39               |
| 5    | **Flush**           | Five cards of same suit, any order                             | 1 in 33               |
| 6    | **Straight**        | Five cards in sequence, mixed suits (e.g., 4-5-6-7-8)          | 1 in 22               |
| 7    | **Three of a Kind** | Three cards of same rank                                       | 1 in 21               |
| 8    | **Two Pair**        | Two different pairs (e.g., two 9s and two 5s)                  | 1 in 4                |
| 9    | **One Pair**        | Two cards of same rank                                         | 1 in 2                |
| 10   | **High Card**       | Nothing above; highest card plays                              | Most common           |

*Probabilities for Texas Hold'em (best 5 of 7 cards). Source: Combinatorial analysis of 133,784,560 possible 7-card
hands.

**The logic:** Rarer hands beat common hands. That's the entire system. A royal flush happens about once in 31,000
Hold'em hands. A pair happens nearly every other hand. Rarity equals strength.

#### The Memory Trick That Actually Works

The part that trips up most beginners is the middle section: Full House, Flush, and Straight. Which beats which? Here's
a visual that sticks:

**A house contains plumbing.** Picture a house. Inside, it has flushing toilets connected by straight pipes. The house
contains the flush, which contains the straight.

```
🏠 Full House
 └─ 🚽 Flush
     └─ ➡️ Straight
```

So: **Full House > Flush > Straight**. The container beats what's inside it.

#### The Three Mistakes Everyone Makes

**Mistake 1: Thinking a straight beats a flush.** It doesn't. A flush (five cards of the same suit) always beats a
straight (five sequential cards of mixed suits). The "plumbing" mnemonic fixes this.

**Mistake 2: The ace wrap-around.** The ace can be high (A-K-Q-J-10) or low (A-2-3-4-5). But it cannot wrap around.
K-A-2-3-4 is *not* a straight. Beginners try this constantly. It doesn't work.

**Mistake 3: Forgetting kickers.** When two players have the same hand type, the side cards (kickers) decide the winner.
You have A-9, your opponent has A-5, the board shows A-K-7-4-2. You both have a pair of aces, but your 9 kicker beats
their 5. Your best five cards: A-A-K-9-7. Theirs: A-A-K-7-5. You win.

#### What You'll Actually See at the Table

Forget about royal flushes. In home games, most pots are won with one pair, two pair, or high card. If you make three of
a kind, you're probably winning. A full house at a casual table usually takes down everything. The monster hands you see
on TV highlights happen because they film thousands of hands and show you the five interesting ones.

### Position Terminology (What Those Abbreviations Mean)

We covered why position matters earlier - acting last gives you information, and good players play 2-3x more hands from
late position. But if you watch poker content or join online discussions, you'll hear specific position names thrown
around. Here's the glossary:

**At a 9-player table, positions go clockwise from the dealer button:**

| Abbreviation  | Name                 | Category | Why It's Called That                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BTN**       | Button               | Late     | The dealer button sits here. Best seat at the table - you act last on every postflop street.                                          |
| **CO**        | Cutoff               | Late     | One seat right of the button. Named because a raise here can "cut off" the button, stealing their positional advantage.               |
| **HJ**        | Hijack               | Middle   | Two seats right of button. A raise can "hijack" the late position by folding out the cutoff and button.                               |
| **LJ**        | Lojack               | Middle   | Three seats right of button. A wordplay on "hijack" - the "low" version of hijack.                                                    |
| **UTG**       | Under the Gun        | Early    | First to act preflop, right after the big blind. Named for the pressure of acting first with no information - you're "under the gun." |
| **UTG+1, +2** | Under the Gun +1, +2 | Early    | The next seats after UTG. Still early position, still tight.                                                                          |
| **SB**        | Small Blind          | Blind    | Posts half the big blind. Acts second-to-last preflop but first postflop - worst position overall.                                    |
| **BB**        | Big Blind            | Blind    | Posts the full blind. Acts last preflop but second postflop.                                                                          |

**The simple version:** Button and cutoff are good. Under the gun is bad. Everything else is somewhere in between. If
you never learn the fancy names, you'll be fine - just remember that seats closer to the button are stronger.

---

### How a Poker Hand Works (Preflop → Postflop → Showdown)

Every Texas Hold'em hand follows the same structure. Understanding this flow is the foundation for everything else.

#### The Setup: Blinds and the Button

Before any cards are dealt, two players post forced bets called [blinds](glossary:blinds). The **small blind** (one seat
left of the dealer button) puts in half the minimum bet. The **big blind** (two seats left) puts in the full minimum.

Why do blinds exist? Without them, everyone could just fold until they got pocket aces. Blinds create something worth
fighting for in every hand.

The **dealer button** (a small disc) marks whose turn it is to "deal." It moves clockwise after each hand, so the blinds
rotate around the table.

#### The Deal: Your Hole Cards

Each player receives two private cards face-down. Only you can see them. This hidden information is what makes poker
poker - you know something your opponents don't, and they know something you don't.

#### Preflop: The First Betting Round

Action starts with the player to the left of the big blind (the "under the gun" position). Each player can:

- **Fold:** Throw away your cards and sit out this hand
- **Call:** Match the big blind amount to stay in
- **Raise:** Increase the bet, forcing others to match or fold

Action moves clockwise. The big blind acts last and has a special option: if nobody raised, they can "check" (stay in
without adding money) since their blind already counts as a bet.

#### The Flop: Three Community Cards

After preflop betting ends, the dealer places three cards face-up in the center. These are **community cards** that
everyone shares. A new betting round begins, but now the first active player to the left of the button acts first.

New options appear when nobody has bet yet:

- **Check:** Pass the action without betting (only available if nobody has bet this round)
- **Bet:** Put chips in the pot, starting the action

Once someone bets, other players must call, raise, or fold - you can't check past a bet.

#### The Turn: Fourth Community Card

After flop betting completes, a fourth community card is added. Another betting round follows the same pattern.

#### The River: Fifth and Final Card

The fifth community card hits the board. This is the last betting round - make it count.

#### Showdown: Who Wins?

If two or more players remain after river betting, they reveal their cards. Each player makes their best five-card hand
from any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards. Best hand takes the pot.

If everyone except one player folds at any point, the last player standing wins without showing their cards. This is why
bluffing works - you can win without the best hand if everyone else gives up.

#### Quick Reference: What Actions Are Available?

| Situation         | Your Options                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| No bet facing you | Check, Bet, Fold                 |
| Bet facing you    | Call, Raise, Fold                |
| Any time          | All-in (bet everything you have) |

#### Common Beginner Confusions

**"When can I check?"** Only when nobody has bet in the current round, or when you're the big blind preflop and nobody
raised.

**"Do I have to use both my hole cards?"** No. You can use two, one, or zero. If the board shows A-K-Q-J-10 of the same
suit, everyone has a royal flush regardless of their cards.

**"What if we have the same hand?"** Split the pot equally. Suits never break ties in Hold'em.

## Step-by-Step Beginner Poker Strategy

Here's your default decision-making framework. Follow this until the patterns become automatic.

---

### Step 1 — Preflop: What Hands to Play

Most beginners play way too many hands. Professional players fold around 70-80% of their starting hands. That's not
pessimism - it's math.

The hands worth playing depend on your position. The later you act, the more hands become profitable.

#### Early Position (Under the Gun, UTG+1, UTG+2)

You're first to act with 5-8 players behind you. Any of them could have a monster. Play tight.

**Raise with:** AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK (suited or offsuit), AQs, AQo, AJs, KQs

**Fold everything else.** Yes, including KJ. Yes, including A9.

#### Middle Position (Lojack, Hijack)

You've seen some folds, so the chance of running into premium hands drops.

**Add:** 99, 88, 77, 66, ATs, A5s (wheel ace for straights/flushes), KJs, KQo, QJs, JTs, T9s

#### Late Position (Cutoff, Button)

The button is the best seat in poker. You act last on every street after the flop, which means you have maximum
information before every decision.

**Add:** 55, 44, 33, 22, suited connectors down to 54s, A4s-A2s, K9s+, ATo, KJo, QJo

When it folds to you on the button or cutoff, you can raise with a wide range. The blinds fold to "steal" attempts
50-60% of the time. Even mediocre hands become profitable when you're winning the blinds that often.

#### The Hands That Trap Beginners

**KJ and QJ:** These look good but constantly run into trouble. When you hit top pair, someone often has a better
kicker (KQ, AK, AQ). You win small pots and lose big ones.

**Weak Aces (A9, A8, A7 offsuit):** When an ace hits, you celebrate. Then your opponent shows AK and you're drawing
nearly dead.

**Small Pairs:** A pair of fives rarely holds up against multiple opponents. Small pairs make money by hitting a set (
three of a kind) on the flop, which only happens 12% of the time. Play them from late position with deep stacks, and be
ready to fold if you miss.

#### The "Raise or Fold" Rule

If a hand is worth playing, it's worth raising. Limping (just calling the big blind) is a losing strategy. Here's why:

1. You give up initiative. A raiser can win by everyone folding. A limper can't.
2. You signal weakness. Good players will raise behind you constantly.
3. You can't win preflop. Raising gives you two ways to win: everyone folds, or you make the best hand. Limping only
   gives you one.

Standard raise size: 2.5 to 3 big blinds. If there are limpers before you, add one big blind per limper.

---

### Step 2 — Using Position to Your Advantage

You already know position matters. Here's how to actually use it.

#### The Same Hand Plays Differently

Consider K♠J♠.

**From under the gun:** This hand sits at the bottom of what's playable from early position. If you raise and get
re-raised, you're in a tough spot - call and play a bloated pot out of position, or fold and waste chips.

**From the button:** The picture changes completely. Everyone has folded or called. You have maximum information and
will act last on every street. KJ becomes an easy raise. You can steal the blinds, and if called, your positional
advantage makes the hand far more profitable.

Same cards. Different positions. Different decisions.

#### What You Gain When You Have Position

**Information:** When your opponent checks, they're often signaling weakness. When they bet, you know before you decide.
Use this to call light when they seem weak and fold when they show strength.

**Pot control:** You decide how big the pot gets. With a medium-strength hand, check behind to keep things small. With a
monster, bet for value. You're the architect.

**Bluffing power:** Bluffs work better in position because you've seen your opponent's action first. A check from them
followed by a bet from you tells a convincing story.

#### Surviving Out of Position

Sometimes you're stuck acting first. Minimize the damage:

**Tighten up.** The blinds may act last preflop, but you'll act first on every street after. Stick to stronger hands.

**Use the check-raise.** This is your primary weapon when out of position. Check to the aggressor, then raise when they
bet. It protects your checking range and builds pots with your strong hands.

**Accept smaller pots.** With marginal hands out of position, keep pots manageable. Check-call rather than leading out.
Your goal is minimizing losses, not maximizing wins.

#### The Simple Framework: "Later = Looser"

- **Early position:** Top 10-15% of hands
- **Middle position:** 15-25% of hands
- **Button/Cutoff:** 30-50% of hands when folded to you

This single adjustment - playing tighter early and wider late - will improve your results more than any other concept.

---

### Step 3 — Postflop: The Three Questions

Most beginners freeze up after the flop. Too many possibilities, too much uncertainty. Cut through the noise with three
questions:

#### Question 1: Do I Have a Strong Made Hand?

Strong made hands include top pair with a good kicker, two pair, sets (three of a kind), straights, flushes, and better.

**If yes: Bet for value.** You want worse hands to call. Bet around half to two-thirds of the pot. Don't get cute -
strong hands make money by building pots, not by trapping.

#### Question 2: Do I Have a Strong Draw?

Strong draws include flush draws (9 outs), open-ended straight draws (8 outs), and combination draws (flush draw +
straight draw).

**If yes: Consider semi-bluffing.** A semi-bluff is a bet with a hand that's not currently best but has a good chance to
improve. You can win two ways: everyone folds now, or you hit your draw and win at showdown.

Calculate your pot odds before calling a bet. Count your outs (cards that complete your hand), multiply by 2 for one
card to come or by 4 for two cards. That's roughly your percentage chance of hitting.

Example: You have a flush draw (9 outs). 9 × 2 = 18% on the turn. If the pot offers better than 4:1 odds, calling is
profitable.

#### Question 3: Do I Have Nothing?

Nothing means bottom pair, no pair, weak draws with poor odds.

**If yes: Fold to pressure.** Don't call "to see what happens." Don't convince yourself they're bluffing. At low stakes,
when people bet, they usually have something. Save your chips for better spots.

#### Reading the Board

**Dry boards** (like A-7-2 rainbow) favor the preflop raiser. Few draws available, someone usually has the best hand
already. Bet your strong hands, fold your weak ones.

**Wet boards** (like 9-8-7 with two hearts) are dangerous. Many draws, ranges connect differently. Be careful with
one-pair hands - you're often either way ahead or way behind.

#### Bet Sizing Basics

- **Half to two-thirds pot** is standard for most situations
- **Bigger bets** when the board is wet and you want to charge draws
- **Smaller bets** on dry boards where you want calls from worse hands

Avoid min-bets (they give great odds to draws) and giant overbets (they fold out everything you beat).

---

### Step 4 — Traps That Catch Beginners

Knowing what to do is half the battle. The other half is knowing what *not* to do. Here are the traps that cost
beginners the most money.

#### Trap 1: Top Pair, Terrible Kicker

You hold K-4 and the flop comes K-7-2. Top pair! You bet, get called. Turn is a 9, you bet again, they raise. You call.
River is a 3, they shove.

The problem: Your 4 kicker means you're dominated by K-Q, K-J, K-T, K-9, and even K-7 (which now has two pair). When you
hit top pair with a weak kicker and face serious aggression, ask yourself: "What worse hands are raising here?" If you
can't name any, fold.

#### Trap 2: The Calling Station Death Spiral

You hold J-9 suited. Flop: K-J-3. Middle pair with a decent kicker. They bet, you call. Turn: 7. Bigger bet, you call
because "they might be bluffing." River: 2. Huge bet, you call because "I've come this far."

The problem: Against most betting ranges, middle pair is a bluff-catcher at best. And most low-stakes players don't
bluff enough to justify calling three streets. One call is reasonable. Two is generous. Three is a donation.

#### Trap 3: Playing Big Pots Out of Position

You have Q-J in the small blind. You call a raise. Flop: Q-8-4. You check, they bet, you call. Turn: 6. You check,
bigger bet. Now what?

The problem: Without position, you can't control anything. You don't know if they have A-Q, K-Q, Q-T, a set, or complete
air. Marginal hands played out of position create impossible spots. If you wouldn't be comfortable check-raising or
betting three streets with it, consider folding preflop.

#### Trap 4: Slow-Playing Into Disaster

You flop a set of 7s on a board of Q-7-5 with two hearts. Instead of betting, you check to "trap." They check behind.
Turn is the J of hearts - now the flush draw got there and there's a straight draw too.

The problem: Slow-playing gives free cards. When the board has flush draws or straight draws, bet your strong hands.
Yes, sometimes they'll fold. That's far better than watching them hit a miracle for free.

#### Trap 5: The Sunk Cost Spiral

You've already put 40% of your stack in the pot. Your opponent makes a big river bet. You think: "I've invested too much
to fold now."

The problem: Those chips are gone. They're not yours anymore. The only question that matters: "Given this bet size, my
hand, and what they likely have, is calling profitable?" Past investments are irrelevant. Poker punishes emotional
attachment to money you've already bet.

#### Trap 6: Fancy Play Syndrome

You have pocket aces. Instead of raising, you just call to "disguise your hand." Three players see the flop: J-T-8 with
two spades. Suddenly you're in a bloated pot with the most dangerous board possible.

The problem: At low stakes, most opponents think only about their own cards. Your elaborate deception? They're not
picking up on it. Bet your good hands, fold your bad hands, save the fancy stuff for when you're crushing your current
stakes.

#### Red Flag Situations: Auto-Fold Territory

**Turn check-raise from a passive player:** When someone who usually just calls suddenly check-raises the turn, they
have at least two pair. This is not a bluff.

**Multiple players, multiple bets:** Three players in the pot, someone bets and someone raises before it gets to you?
Your top pair is worthless. The combined ranges here will crush you.

**Big river bet from a quiet player:** That player who's been calling all night suddenly pots it on the river? They have
the goods. Passive players don't bluff rivers. Save your hero calls for a different opponent.

## Putting It Together: Three Real Hands

Theory only goes so far. Here's what good decision-making looks like in practice.

### Hand 1: Value Betting a Premium (Pocket Kings)

**Setup:** $1/$2 game. You have $200 on the button. A loose-passive player in middle position limps for $2. You look
down at K♠K♥.

**Preflop:** Don't trap. With the second-best starting hand in poker, build a pot. You raise
to $12. Small blind folds, big blind calls, the limper calls. Pot: $37.

**Flop: J♦8♣3♠**

This is a great flop for your kings - no ace, no flush draws, your overpair is almost certainly best. How much to bet?

Your thinking: "I have an overpair on a dry board. Both opponents likely have hands like QJ, JT, 99, or random suited
cards. I want value from worse hands - especially that loose player who loves calling. Two-thirds pot."

You bet $25. Big blind folds. The limper thinks and calls. Pot: $87.

**Turn: 5♥**

Total blank. Your kings are still best. The loose player would have raised a set on the flop.

You bet $55. He calls. Pot: $197.

**River: 2♦**

Another brick. You have about $108 left.

Bet again? Absolutely. This player has shown he'll call with marginal hands. Make him pay. You bet $75. He sighs, says "
I have to see it," and calls with J♠T♥. Top pair, mediocre kicker.

You scoop $347.

**The lesson:** Premium hands make money through value extraction, not deception. Bet every street when you're ahead.
Against calling stations, slowplaying costs you money.

---

### Hand 2: Playing a Flush Draw With Pot Odds

**Setup:** $1/$2 game. You're on the button with $180. A tight-aggressive player in the hijack opens to $8. One caller.
You look at A♠9♠ - suited ace in position, worth a call.

Three players to the flop. Pot: $27.

**Flop: K♠7♠2♣**

You've flopped the nut flush draw - nine spades remain in the deck. You don't have a made hand yet, but you have a
powerful draw.

The original raiser bets $18 into $27. The other player folds.

Your thinking: "I need a spade to win. Nine outs. The rule of 2-and-4 says multiply by 2 for one card: 9 × 2 = 18% on
the turn."

The pot is $45 ($27 + $18). You need to call $18 to stay in. That's pot odds of about 2.5:1, meaning you need roughly
28% equity. Your 18% on the turn alone doesn't quite get there.

But: you have implied odds. If you hit the flush, this tight player with a strong range will likely pay you off. And
your ace might be good sometimes.

You call. Pot: $63.

**Turn: 4♠**

Bingo. The flush arrives. Opponent checks.

How to extract value? A tight player who checks here after betting the flop is often giving up or scared of the flush.
If you bet big, he might fold. A smaller bet might look like a steal attempt.

You bet $35 (about half pot). He thinks, then calls. Pot: $133.

**River: J♦**

He checks. You bet $60. He makes a frustrated call with K♦Q♦.

**The lesson:** Drawing hands require math, not hope. Know your outs, calculate your odds, continue only when the price
is right. When you hit, extract maximum value - opponents who've invested this much rarely find folds.

---

### Hand 3: The Disciplined Fold (Pocket Queens)

**Setup:** $1/$2 game. You're in the hijack with $220. A tight, experienced player in early position (UTG+1) opens to $
10. This player has been quiet all night - when he enters pots, he has something real.

You look at Q♠Q♥. Premium hand. You three-bet to $32.

Everyone folds back to the original raiser. He thinks for ten seconds, then four-bets to $85.

**Your thinking:** "This is a tight player who opened under the gun. I raised, and instead of calling, he four-bet.
Against this specific player, his range is almost certainly AA, KK, or maybe AK. Two of those hands crush me. One is a
coin flip. Calling to see a flop means I'll stack off 200 big blinds as an 80% underdog if he has aces or kings."

You fold face-up. "Nice hand."

He shows A♠A♥ with a slight smile. You just saved $135 - and potentially your entire stack.

**Why this fold is correct:** Many beginners can't fold queens preflop. "But it's QQ! Third-best hand!" Yes, but hand
strength is relative to what your opponent represents. When a tight player screams strength through their betting,
believe them.

**The disaster you avoided:** Imagine calling. Flop comes J♦8♣3♥. Looks safe! You bet, he raises all-in. You convince
yourself he might have AK and call. He doesn't. You're broke.

**The lesson:** Good poker isn't just about playing your cards - it's about playing your opponent's likely range. The
money you save by folding strong-but-beaten hands is as valuable as the money you win with monsters.

## Your Path Forward

You've got the foundations. Here's what comes next.

### Phase 1: Solidify the Basics

Before moving on, make sure you're comfortable with:

- Playing position-aware starting hands without hesitation
- Pot odds calculations for common draws
- Folding when you're beat, even with a "good" hand
- Finishing sessions without major tilt episodes

**You're ready for Phase 2 when:** You're no longer thinking about *what* to play - you're curious about *why* certain
plays work.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts

**Hand ranges:** Stop putting opponents on one exact hand. Instead, think about the *range* of hands they could have. "
He raised from early position, so his range is weighted toward big pairs and strong aces." This shift from "he has AK"
to "he has a range" changes everything.

**Continuation betting:** When you raise preflop and get called, betting the flop is called a "c-bet." Learn when to
c-bet (dry boards that favor your range) versus when to check (wet boards where your opponent likely connected).

**Board texture:** A flop of A-7-2 rainbow is "dry" - few draws, one player likely has the best hand. A flop of 9-8-7
with two hearts is "wet" - many draws, ranges overlap. Adjust your aggression accordingly.

**Player profiling:** Categorize opponents as TAG (tight-aggressive), LAG (loose-aggressive), tight-passive, or
loose-passive. Within 20-30 hands, you should have a read.

how many hands you play), PFR (how often you raise), WTSD (how often you reach showdown).

**For everyone:** Mark interesting hands during play. Spend 15 minutes afterward asking: "What was I trying to
accomplish? What range did I put them on? Would I play it differently?"

**Signs you're improving:**

- You spot mistakes opponents make
- You fold hands you would've called six months ago
- Bad beats sting less because you know you played correctly

**Signs you're ready to move up stakes:**

- Consistent winning results over 2-3 months (not just a heater)
- Bankroll of at least 20-30 buy-ins for your target stake
- You can identify exploitable tendencies at the higher level

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

### Preflop Ranges (Simplified)

| Position               | Raise These Hands                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Early (UTG, UTG+1)** | AA-TT, AK, AQ, AJs, KQs                             |
| **Middle (LJ, HJ)**    | Add 99-66, ATs, KJs, QJs, JTs                       |
| **Late (CO, BTN)**     | Add 55-22, suited connectors, suited aces, broadway |
| **Blinds**             | Defend tight, 3-bet premiums                        |

### Postflop Decision Tree

```
Do I have a strong made hand?
├── YES → Bet for value (1/2 to 2/3 pot)
└── NO → Do I have a strong draw?
    ├── YES → Check pot odds. Good odds? Call/semi-bluff. Bad odds? Fold.
    └── NO → Fold to pressure. Don't pay to "see what happens."
```

### Red Flags (Consider Folding)

- Turn check-raise from a passive player
- Big river bet from someone who's been quiet
- Multiple players still in with bets and raises
- You're asking "but what if they're bluffing?" more than once

### The Core Rules

1. **Play tight from early position, wider from late position**
2. **Raise or fold - don't limp**
3. **Bet your strong hands for value**
4. **Fold when the math says fold**
5. **Position beats cards over the long run**
6. **If you're tilting, stop playing**
