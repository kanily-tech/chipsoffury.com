Poker has been played in dozens of forms over the years, from classic saloon games to modern online tournaments. If you’re new to the game, that variety can feel overwhelming fast. With so many rulesets, formats, and betting structures, it’s natural to wonder which versions of poker actually matter — and which ones you can safely ignore for now.

That’s where poker variants come in. A *poker variant* simply refers to a specific version of the game, defined by how cards are dealt, how hands are formed, and how betting works. While there are many variations of poker, only a small handful dominate how poker is played today — both online and live.

This guide focuses on the **five most popular poker variants** you’ll encounter in real games, casinos, home setups, and online platforms. Instead of listing every obscure poker game type, we’re prioritizing relevance, popularity, and beginner-friendliness. By the end, you’ll know exactly which poker games are worth learning first — and why.

## 1. Texas Hold’em

### What Is Texas Hold’em?

Texas Hold’em is the most widely played poker game in the world. Each player is dealt **two private hole cards**, and five **community cards** are placed face-up in the center of the table. Every player uses a combination of their hole cards and the community cards to make the best possible five-card hand.

The community cards are revealed in stages:
- The **flop** (three cards)
- The **turn** (one card)
- The **river** (one card)

This shared-card format is one of the reasons Hold’em is so easy to follow — everyone sees the same board, and the core challenge is deciding how your hidden cards interact with it.

## 2. Omaha (Pot-Limit Omaha)

### How Omaha Differs From Hold’em

Omaha looks similar to Hold’em on the surface but changes the game dramatically. Each player receives **four hole cards** instead of two — and must use **exactly two** of them, plus **three community cards**, to make a hand.

Most Omaha games use a **pot-limit** betting structure, which caps bets based on the size of the pot.

### Why Omaha Is So Popular

Omaha is loved for:

- More draws and action  
- High popularity in online and high-stakes cash games

### Is Omaha Beginner-Friendly?
