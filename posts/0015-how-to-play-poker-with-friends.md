tables, and hybrid play (physical cards + virtual chips) have become the new norm.

This guide walks you through **every way to play**, how to choose the right platform, a clear rundown of the rules, and
beginner strategies your group can use immediately. When you’re ready to go deeper on specific concepts (preflop charts,
hand rankings, poker lingo, etc.), you’ll also find natural paths to more advanced explanations throughout this article.

Chips of Fury remains the default recommendation because it’s the **most beginner-friendly**, works with every game
mode, and removes the math that usually slows new players down.

## Ways To Play Poker As A Beginner

Most players don’t realize there are **three** distinct ways to play poker with friends online — each ideal for
different setups.

### Option 1 — Use Physical Cards + Virtual Poker Chips App

![Chips of Fury app on phone and tablet alongside real playing cards](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/chips_only_example.webp)

Perfect for in-person home games, families, and teaching nights.

Everyone uses physical cards while a virtual chips app like **Chips of Fury** handles:

- Bets
- Stacks
- Pot sizing
- Side pots
- Settlements

If you’ve ever struggled with buy-ins or balancing stacks manually, you’ll appreciate how much smoother things feel.

This hybrid setup teaches beginners the *real game* without overwhelming them.

### Option 2 — Fully Online Poker (Web or Mobile Apps)

![Side-by-side screenshots of Chips of Fury, Poker Now, and unmasked.poker](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/poker_apps.webp)

This is the classic approach when everyone is remote.

Platforms include:

- **Chips of Fury**
- **Poker Now**
- **Poker Patio**
- **unmasked.poker**

Fully online tables are best for groups that want seamless play without relying on physical cards. If you're curious
about the variations beyond Texas Hold’em or Omaha, our breakdown of the five most popular poker variants will help you
choose what your group might enjoy next.

### Option 3 — IRL (in real life) play but with an app instead of cards and chips

![Chips of Fury Virtual Poker interface with hole cards facing down](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/virtual_poker_irl.webp)

Great for when you want to have an impromptu game without any physical items.

Scenarios include:

- Playing in a small space, like a cozy coffee shop or a dive bar
- Want to just play fast with lots of hands per hour
- Travelling/Camping/Hiking and not carrying any cards & chips

No matter how youp play, fo quick casual games, a set of agreed-upon poker house rules keeps games moving and avoids
confusion, especially with newer players. You can save a template of your favorite settings in Chips of Fury for easy
reuse.

## Poker Game Types & Variations (Beginners' Guide)

Poker nights — they almost always start with Texas Hold'em. And that's fine! But give it a few
months, and someone's gonna suggest trying something different. "What about Omaha?" or "I heard Pineapple is wild."

When that happens (and it will), we've got deeper dives
into [Omaha Hold'em rules](#tobepublished)
and [Crazy Pineapple / Pineapple rules](#tobepublished) ready for you.

### Texas Hold'em

<div class="not-prose">
{% renderTemplate "webc" %}
<poker-table-holdem></poker-table-holdem>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
</div>

There's a reason this is the one you see on TV. Two hole cards, five community cards, and enough strategic depth to keep
you hooked for years — yet simple enough that your friend who's "never really played cards" can pick it up in one round.

Start here. Seriously.

Our [Texas Hold'em rules](#tobepublished) guide walks through
everything: blinds, betting rounds, showdowns, the whole nine yards.

### Omaha

<div class="not-prose">
{% renderTemplate "webc" %}
<poker-table-omaha></poker-table-omaha>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
</div>

Four hole cards instead of two. Sounds like a small change, right? It's not.

Omaha cranks up the action because everyone's sitting on more potential hands — which means bigger pots, crazier
showdowns, and that one friend who keeps forgetting they *must* use exactly two cards from their hand. (We all have that
friend.)

When your group's ready to level up, the [Omaha rules overview](#tobepublished)
breaks down the nuances.

### Pineapple / Crazy Pineapple

<div class="not-prose">
{% renderTemplate "webc" %}
<poker-table-crazy-pineapple></poker-table-crazy-pineapple>
{% endrenderTemplate %}
</div>

Want chaos? This is the variant for you.

You get three hole cards, then toss one after the flop. It's Hold'em's wilder cousin — more playable starting hands,
more "I can't believe that hit" moments, and honestly just more fun for casual nights where nobody's taking things too
seriously.

Check out our [Crazy Pineapple rules breakdown](#tobepublished) if your crew
wants to shake things up.

### Cash Games vs Tournaments

Quick distinction that trips up new players:

**Cash games** let you buy in, cash out, and leave whenever. Chips equal real value (or whatever your group's tracking).
Perfect for beginners because there's no pressure — lose your stack, rebuy, keep hanging out.

**Tournaments** are less common in home games. Everyone starts with the same chips, blinds increase over time, and
you're out when you're out. More structured, more strategic, but also more commitment. They can be useful if you 
want to keep strict time bounds and not have people coming and going.
