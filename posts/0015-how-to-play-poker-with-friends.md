Playing poker with friends online has never been easier — especially in 2025, where beginner-friendly apps, private
tables, and hybrid play (physical cards + virtual chips) have become the new norm.

This guide walks you through **every way to play**, how to choose the right platform, a clear rundown of the rules, and
beginner strategies your group can use immediately. When you’re ready to go deeper on specific concepts (preflop charts,
hand rankings, poker lingo, etc.), you’ll also find natural paths to more advanced explanations throughout this article.

Chips of Fury remains the default recommendation because it’s the **most beginner-friendly**, works with every game
mode, and removes the math that usually slows new players down.

## Ways To Play Poker As A Beginner

Most players don’t realize there are **three** distinct ways to play poker with friends online — each ideal for
different setups.

### Option 1 — Use Physical Cards + Virtual Poker Chips App

![Chips of Fury app on phone and tablet alongside real playing cards](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/chips_only_example.webp)

Perfect for in-person home games, families, and teaching nights.

Everyone uses physical cards while a virtual chips app like **Chips of Fury** handles:

- Bets
- Stacks
- Pot sizing
- Side pots
- Settlements

If you’ve ever struggled with buy-ins or balancing stacks manually, you’ll appreciate how much smoother things feel.

This hybrid setup teaches beginners the *real game* without overwhelming them.

### Option 2 — Fully Online Poker (Web or Mobile Apps)

![Side-by-side screenshots of Chips of Fury, Poker Now, and unmasked.poker](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/poker_apps.webp)

This is the classic approach when everyone is remote.

Platforms include:

- **Chips of Fury**
- **Poker Now**
- **unmasked.poker**

Fully online tables are best for groups that want seamless play without relying on physical cards. If you're curious
about the variations beyond Texas Hold’em or Omaha, our breakdown of the five most popular poker variants will help you
choose what your group might enjoy next.

### Option 3 — IRL (in real life) play but with an app instead of cards and chips

![Chips of Fury Virtual Poker interface with hole cards facing down](/images/posts/how-to-play-with-friends/virtual_poker_irl.webp)

Great for when you want to have an impromptu game without any physical items.

Scenarios include:

- Playing in a small space, like a cozy coffee shop or a dive bar
- Want to just play fast with lots of hands per hour
- Travelling/Camping/Hiking and not carrying any cards & chips

No matter how youp play, fo quick casual games, a set of agreed-upon poker house rules keeps games moving and avoids
confusion, especially with newer players. You can save a template of your favorite settings in Chips of Fury for easy
reuse.

## Why Chips of Fury Stands Out for Home Games

- True cross-platform: native iOS/Android plus browser; works on any modern device.
- Zero friction: share a code (or direct link), no accounts; great for drop-in friends.
- Live game mode: only app here that tracks chips when you play with physical cards.
- Variety for dealer’s choice: 15+ variants (Hold'em, four Omahas, Short Deck, Pineapple trio, Irish, Watermelon, Double
  Board, more).
- Fair pricing: free forever for common features (play Texas Hold'em, Omaha for free); low-cost Pro plan for access to 
  all features.

---

## When Another App Might Be Better

- You’re joining or managing large online clubs: PPPoker or ClubGG. For the rest of the use-cases, Chips of Fury, or 
  any of the other apps as well work better.

## Poker Game Types & Variations (Beginners’ Guide)

Many groups eventually branch out beyond Hold’em. When you do, the deeper rule breakdowns in
our [Omaha Hold’em rules](https://chipsoffury.com/posts/omaha-holdem-poker-rules/)
and [Crazy Pineapple / Pineapple rules](https://chipsoffury.com/posts/crazy-pineapple-poker-rules/) guides are great

We have a complete [Crazy Pineapple rules breakdown](https://chipsoffury.com/posts/crazy-pineapple-poker-rules/) if your
group wants something more casual and chaotic.
