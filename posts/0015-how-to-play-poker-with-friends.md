*By Avery Lane — Poker player, home-game host, and SEO writer.*

Playing poker with friends online has never been easier — especially in 2025, where beginner-friendly apps, private tables, and hybrid play (physical cards + virtual chips) have become the new norm.

This guide walks you through **every way to play**, how to choose the right platform, a clear rundown of the rules, and beginner strategies your group can use immediately. When you’re ready to go deeper on specific concepts (preflop charts, hand rankings, poker lingo, etc.), you’ll also find natural paths to more advanced explanations throughout this article.

Chips of Fury remains the default recommendation because it’s the **most beginner-friendly**, works with every game mode, and removes the math that usually slows new players down.

## Ways To Play Poker As A Beginner

Most players don’t realize there are **three** distinct ways to play poker with friends online — each ideal for different setups.

### Option 1 — Use Physical Cards + Virtual Poker Chips App

Perfect for in-person home games, families, and teaching nights.

Everyone uses physical cards while a virtual chips app like **Chips of Fury** handles:

- Bets
- Stacks
- Pot sizing
- Side pots

If you’ve ever struggled with buy-ins or balancing stacks manually, you’ll appreciate how much smoother things feel. (For a deeper dive in managing this part of the night, see our guide on handling poker buy-ins with friends.)

This hybrid setup teaches beginners the *real game* without overwhelming them.

### Option 2 — Hybrid Play (Physical Cards + Remote Players + Virtual Chips)

Great for groups who want to combine in-person and online players.

Use:

- Physical cards for local players
- Chips of Fury for chip tracking
- Discord/Zoom for remote players

With hybrid groups, clarity is everything — including setting expectations. A quick set of agreed-upon poker house rules keeps games moving and avoids confusion, especially with newer players.

### Option 3 — Fully Online Poker (Web or Mobile Apps)

This is the classic approach when everyone is remote.

Platforms include:

- **Chips of Fury**
- **Poker Now**
- **unmasked.poker**

Fully online tables are best for groups that want seamless play without relying on physical cards. If you're curious about the variations beyond Texas Hold’em or Omaha, our breakdown of the five most popular poker variants will help you choose what your group might enjoy next.
