## 📘 Poker Lingo Glossary (A–Z)

## A

### Action
Any betting decision made by a player — check, bet, call, raise, or fold.

**Example:**  
“The action is on you.”

**Why this matters:**  
Knowing when it’s your turn to act prevents costly mistakes and confusion at the table.

---

### Ace-High
A hand where an Ace is the highest card, but there is no pair or better.

**Example:**  
“I missed the flop and only have ace-high.”

**Why this matters:**  
Ace-high sounds strong, but it often isn’t — beginners overvalue it.

---

### All-In
Putting all of your remaining chips into the pot.

**Example:**  
“He went all-in before the flop.”

**Why this matters:**  
All-ins create pressure and can end the hand immediately.

---

### Ante
A small forced bet posted by all players before a hand begins (common in tournaments).

**Example:**  
“Everyone antes before the cards are dealt.”

**Why this matters:**  
Antes increase pot size and encourage more action.

---

## B

### Backdoor Draw
A draw that requires help on both the turn and river to complete.

**Example:**  
“I have a backdoor flush draw.”

**Why this matters:**  
Backdoor draws are weak but can add small value to a hand.

---

Losing a hand despite being a heavy favorite.

**Example:**  
“I lost with aces — total bad beat.”

**Why this matters:**  
Understanding bad beats helps control tilt and emotions.

---

**Example:**  
“I manage my bankroll carefully.”

**Why this matters:**  
Poor bankroll management is one of the fastest ways beginners go broke.

---

**Example:**  
“I bet half the pot.”

**Why this matters:**  
Betting controls pot size and puts pressure on opponents.

---
