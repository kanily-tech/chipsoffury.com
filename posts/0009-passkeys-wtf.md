Sometime back while researching about auth, I wrote a post [about passkeys](/posts/researching_passkey_auth).

It has been 7 months since, and everytime I have come across a passkey based auth on the interwebs, I have been 
utterly confused. Github for example, shows me a link to login with passkey, making me believe that I have one 
for logging in to Github. I don't think I do. And even if I do, I don't know where it is. And if I am not sure
where it is, I hope it cannot be misused.

I can write a longer post about this, but a cursory search throws up many that voice this same mess
- [I Stopped Using Passwords. It’s Great—and a Total Mess](https://www.wired.com/story/stopped-using-passwords-passkeys/)
- [Passkeys are a mess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/1aqhc3z/passkeys_are_a_mess/)
- [Passkey use confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/1Password/comments/18r845e/passkey_use_confusion/)
etc.

So I take my words back. Implementing passkeys on CoF is a hard PASS.
