Nothing derails a home game faster than fuzzy money rules. One minute everyone’s laughing, the next you’re the awkward
banker, making change with crumpled twenties, chasing Venmo requests, and explaining why “I’ll just buy in for fifteen”
doesn’t work when the blinds are a quarter and a half.

Get the buy-in structure right, though, and the chips aren’t the only thing that stacks—so do the good vibes. The
following guide skips the textbook theory and gives you the practical playbook hosts have road-tested for years. Copy
what works, ignore what doesn’t, and you’ll spend less time herding cats and more time actually playing cards.

**The People-First Rule**  
Veteran hosts swear by it: if everyone at the table can lose three buy-ins without checking their phone for a bank
balance, you’ve nailed the stakes. Too low and nobody cares; too high and the fun evaporates. Aim for that sweet spot
where a bad beat still leaves everyone laughing.

**Money Etiquette That Saves Friendships**

- **Hit-and-run protection**: Agree on a one-orbit notice before cashing out. Winning a monster pot and sprinting for
  the door is a one-way ticket to the “not invited back” list.
- **No “going south”**: Once chips hit the felt, they stay there until you’re done for the night. Pocketing profit while
  still in the game is the fastest way to kill trust.
- **Top-ups welcome**: Running low? Add chips between hands, up to the max.
- **One banker**: Single person handles cash and chips. Keeps math simple and arguments at zero.

**Buy-In Blueprint**  
Blinds set the tempo. For a $0.25 / $0.50 game:

- **Minimum**: $10–25 (20-50 big blinds)
- **Maximum**: $50–100 (100-200 big blinds)

Start on the lower end; you can always raise the cap later if the group wants deeper play.

**Chip Stacks Without the Headache**  
Forget multi-page spreadsheets. Give each player plenty of workhorse chips (the ones that match the blind size) and a
couple of bigger denoms for rebuys. Example for a $50 buy-in:

- 20 × $0.25
- 18 × $1
- 5 × $5

Rebuys? Hand out larger chips and let the table make change—keeps the game moving and your brain free of algebra. (Or
skip the math entirely—apps like Chips of Fury handle distribution for you.)

**House Rules in One Breath**  
Two decks rotating, no phones in the pot, bets go in front of you not into the pile, food stays off the felt. Say it
once before the first deal; after that, enforce quietly and consistently.

**Parting Shot**  
Lock the rules, loosen the atmosphere. Handle the money like a pro and the only thing left to argue about is whether
that river card really helped—exactly what a home game should be.
