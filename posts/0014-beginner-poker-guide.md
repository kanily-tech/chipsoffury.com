# Beginner Poker Strategy
*By Avery Lane — Poker Strategy Writer & Long-Time Low-Stakes Cash Game Player*

Poker looks simple from the outside: get good cards, bet, win chips. But beginners quickly learn the truth — you can follow the rules perfectly and still lose money if you don’t understand why winning players make the decisions they do.

This guide fixes that.

Instead of giving you a random list of beginner tips, you’ll get a repeatable playflow for every hand of Texas Hold’em, plus the core math, psychology, and discipline habits that separate winners from long-term losers.

## Before You Play — The Beginner Mindset

### Why Most Beginners Lose (And How to Avoid It)
Most new players rely on gut feeling, curiosity calls, and too many weak hands. They misunderstand position and make emotional decisions after losing pots.

This guide counters those weaknesses with tight, aggressive play and disciplined fundamentals.

---

### The Three Pillars of Winning Poker: Math, Psychology, Discipline

**Math:** Understand hand rankings, ranges, pot odds, and EV.  
**Psychology:** Recognize patterns in tight vs loose players.  
**Discipline:** Fold early, fold often, fold correctly.

---

### Setting Expectations: Variance, Luck & Long-Term Thinking
Poker has variance — short-term swings. Your goal is to make +EV decisions so luck matters less over thousands of hands.

---

## The Poker Basics You Must Master First

### Hand Rankings (Simple Memory Framework)
Royal Flush → Straight Flush → Four of a Kind → Full House → Flush → Straight → Three of a Kind → Two Pair → One Pair → High Card.

Beginner rule: If it doesn’t beat top pair by the river, fold to heavy pressure.

---

### Table Position Explained (Late Position = Power)
Position determines when you act:

- Early = weakest  
- Middle = moderate  
- Late = strongest  
- Blinds = forced, weak postflop

Play more hands in late position.

---

### How a Poker Hand Works (Preflop → Postflop → Showdown)
1. Preflop  
2. Flop  
3. Turn  
4. River  
5. Showdown  

---

## Step-by-Step Beginner Poker Strategy (Your Default Playflow)

---

### Step 1 — Preflop Hand Selection (What to Play & Fold)

**Early Position:** AA–TT, AK, AQ  
**Middle:** Add AJ, KQ, 99–88  
**Late:** Add AT, KJ, QJ, suited connectors (98s–54s), 77–66  
**Blinds:** Play tight

---

### Step 2 — Use Position to Your Advantage
Act last when possible. Raise more often from the cutoff and button.

---

### Step 3 — Bet Aggressively With Strong Hands
Raise instead of calling. Do not limp. Bet strong hands for value. Avoid fancy bluffs.

---

### Step 4 — Postflop Decision Framework (The 3 Questions Rule)
1. Do I have a strong made hand?  
2. Do I have a strong draw?  
3. Do I have nothing? Fold to pressure.

---

### Step 5 — Avoid Traps & High-Risk Spots
- Overvaluing top pair  
- Calling down with weak pairs  
- Playing out of position  
- Slow-playing strong hands
