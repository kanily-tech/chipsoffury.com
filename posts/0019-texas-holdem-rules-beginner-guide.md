## What Is Texas Hold’em?

Texas Hold’em is the most popular version of poker in the world. It’s played in casinos, home games, and poker apps, and it’s usually the first poker game beginners learn.

Each player is dealt **two private cards**, called *hole cards*. Five **community cards** are placed face-up in the center of the table. Everyone uses the same community cards, but combines them with their own hole cards to make the best possible hand.

That shared-card format is what makes Texas Hold’em easy to follow and fun to learn — you’re all reacting to the same cards as they appear.

## The Goal of Texas Hold’em

The goal is simple.

You win a hand in one of two ways:

- Having the **best five-card poker hand** at showdown  
- Getting **all other players to fold** before the showdown  

You don’t need to win every hand — or even most hands. You’re just trying to make good decisions one hand at a time.

## What You Need to Play

### Players & Cards

Texas Hold’em is typically played with **2 to 10 players** using a standard **52-card deck**. No jokers.

Each player gets two private cards, and five community cards are shared by everyone.

### Chips & Table Setup

Instead of playing with cash directly, poker uses **chips** to represent money or points. This keeps betting simple and consistent.

Players sit around a circular table, and each hand moves clockwise. Where you sit matters later on, but as a beginner, you only need to know when it’s your turn.

## Understanding the Blinds & Dealer Button

This is one of the most confusing parts for new players — so let’s slow it down.

### The Dealer Button

The **dealer button** is a small disk that marks who is considered the dealer for that hand. The dealer doesn’t physically deal cards, but the button determines **betting order**.

After every hand, the button moves one seat to the left.

### Small Blind & Big Blind

The two players to the left of the dealer post forced bets before any cards are dealt:

- **Small blind** – the smaller forced bet  
- **Big blind** – the larger forced bet  

These are called **blinds**.

Blinds exist to keep the game moving and ensure there’s always something to play for in every hand.

## How a Hand of Texas Hold’em Works (Step by Step)

Every hand follows the same sequence. Once you understand this flow, Texas Hold’em becomes much easier to follow.

**Media Suggestion:**  
Horizontal flowchart labeled: Deal → Preflop → Flop → Turn → River → Showdown.

### Step 1 – The Deal (Hole Cards)

Each player is dealt **two cards face down**. These are your hole cards, and only you can see them.

---

### Step 2 – Preflop Betting

The first round of betting is called **preflop**.

Each player chooses one action:

- **Fold** – give up the hand  
- **Call** – match the current bet  
- **Raise** – increase the bet  

If you fold, your hand is over.

---

### Step 3 – The Flop

Three community cards are dealt face-up in the center of the table.

Everyone now uses these cards along with their hole cards to build a hand.

**Media Suggestion:**

---

### Step 4 – The Turn

A fourth community card is revealed. This card is called **the turn**.

Another betting round follows.

---

### Step 5 – The River

The fifth and final community card is revealed. This is called **the river**.

There is one last betting round.

---

### Step 6 – The Showdown

If two or more players remain, the hand goes to a **showdown**.

Players reveal their cards, and the player with the **best five-card hand** wins the pot.

If everyone else folds earlier, the remaining player wins automatically.

## Poker Hand Rankings (What Beats What)

Poker hands are ranked from strongest to weakest. You always use **five cards total**, made from any combination of your hole cards and the community cards.

You **do not need to memorize this** — most poker apps show hand rankings automatically.

**Media Suggestion:**
