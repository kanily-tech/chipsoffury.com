If you’ve ever tried to organize 	an online poker night with friends, you already know the problem: **most poker apps aren’t built for private games**.

They’re built for public tables, real-money play, constant ads, bots, or grinding tournaments with strangers. What should be a relaxed home-game vibe turns into friction, confusion, or drop-offs before the first hand is even dealt.

This guide exists for one simple reason: **to help you and your friends actually play poker together online — easily, privately, and without nonsense**.

Before we start, a quick transparency note:  
**One of the apps on this list is our own.** I’ve included it not because it’s “the best for everyone,” but because it’s one of the main options people consider when searching for poker with friends apps — and you deserve to see how it honestly compares.

## Looking for a Poker App You Can Actually Play With Friends?

Most people searching for a *poker app to play with friends* are **not** looking for:

- Real-money gambling  
- Public tournaments  
- Aggressive monetization  
- Complex lobbies and confusing rulesets  

They’re looking for:

- A **private poker table**  
- Simple setup  
- Mobile-friendly play  
- A social, home-game feel  

This article will help you choose the app that best fits *your* group — whether that’s a casual Friday night, a long-running home game, or a quick spur-of-the-moment session.

## What Makes a Great Poker With Friends App?

Before comparing options, here’s what actually matters when playing poker online with friends:

- **Private tables** (invite-only games)
- **Fast setup** (no painful onboarding)
- **Mobile-first design**
- **No real-money pressure**
- **Social features** (chat, smooth UX)
- **Free or fair pricing**

Keep these in mind — they’ll help you judge each app objectively.
