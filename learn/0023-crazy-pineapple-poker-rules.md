If you already know Texas Hold’em, Crazy Pineapple will feel familiar — with one fun twist.

Crazy Pineapple is a variation of Texas Hold’em where you start with an extra card, but you don’t get to keep it for long. This guide explains the rules simply, so you can jump in and play confidently without worrying about messing anything up.

If you understand Hold’em basics, you’re already most of the way there.

## What Is Crazy Pineapple Poker?

Crazy Pineapple poker is a popular poker variant often played in home games, friendly tournaments, and poker apps. It’s known for being fast, fun, and slightly more action-packed than standard Texas Hold’em.

Like Hold’em, Crazy Pineapple uses:
- Community cards  
- Multiple betting rounds  
- Standard poker hand rankings  

The key difference is how many cards you start with — and when you have to let one go.

## How Crazy Pineapple Is Different From Texas Hold’em

This is the most important thing to understand.

In Crazy Pineapple:
- Each player is dealt **three hole cards**, not two  
- After the **flop**, each player must **discard one card**  
- The rest of the hand is played exactly like Texas Hold’em  

That’s it.

This one rule changes everything — but it’s easy once you see it in action.

Because players start with an extra card, more hands connect with the flop. That means more action, more interesting decisions, and more fun.

## The Goal of Crazy Pineapple

The goal of Crazy Pineapple is the same as Texas Hold’em.

You win a hand by:
- Making the **best five-card poker hand**, or  
- Getting **all other players to fold**

The twist isn’t the goal — it’s how you get there.

## What You Need to Play Crazy Pineapple

### Players & Cards

Crazy Pineapple is typically played with:
- **2 to 10 players**  
- A standard **52-card deck**

Each player begins the hand with **three private cards**.

### Chips & Table Setup

Crazy Pineapple uses chips and table layouts identical to Texas Hold’em.

- Circular table  
- Betting moves clockwise  
- Same positions and flow  

If you’ve played Hold’em before, nothing here is new.

**Media Suggestion:**

## Blinds & Dealer Button

The blinds and dealer button work exactly the same way as in Texas Hold’em.

- The **dealer button** marks position  
- The **small blind** and **big blind** are posted before cards are dealt  
- The button moves one seat after each hand  

Blinds keep the game moving and create action.

## How a Hand of Crazy Pineapple Works

The structure of a hand closely follows Texas Hold’em, with one extra step added after the flop.

**Media Suggestion:**

### Step 1 – Dealing the Hole Cards (3 Cards)

Each player is dealt **three cards face down**. These are your hole cards, and only you can see them.

At this point, you don’t discard anything yet.

---

### Step 2 – Preflop Betting

The first betting round happens before any community cards are revealed.

Players can:
- **Fold**  
- **Call**  
- **Raise**

This round plays exactly like Texas Hold’em — except everyone has an extra card.

---

### Step 3 – The Flop

Three community cards are revealed in the center of the table.

At this point, players can see how their three hole cards connect with the board.

---

### Step 4 – Discard One Card

🚨 **Important Rule**

After the flop — and **before** the next betting round — each player must **discard one of their three hole cards**.

- You choose which card to discard  
- Once discarded, it’s out of the hand  
- You now continue the hand with **two hole cards**, just like Hold’em  

This is the moment that defines Crazy Pineapple, and it’s where beginners most often get confused.

### Step 5 – The Turn

A fourth community card is revealed.

With only two hole cards left, the game now plays exactly like Texas Hold’em.

---

### Step 6 – The River

The fifth and final community card is revealed.

This is your last chance to improve your hand.

---

### Step 7 – The Showdown

If two or more players remain, cards are revealed.

Each player makes their best **five-card hand** using:
- Their **two remaining hole cards**  
- The five community cards  

The best hand wins the pot.

---

## Poker Hand Rankings in Crazy Pineapple

Crazy Pineapple uses the **same hand rankings** as Texas Hold’em.

- Straight  
- Flush  
- Full house  
- And so on  

Because players start with an extra card, **stronger hands appear more often**, especially after the flop.

You do **not** need to memorize hand rankings — most poker apps display them automatically.

## Common Beginner Mistakes in Crazy Pineapple

Crazy Pineapple is simple, but a few mistakes come up again and again.

### Forgetting to Discard

Every player must discard **after the flop**. Forgetting this is the most common error.

### Discarding Too Early

You do **not** discard before the flop. Wait until after the first three community cards are revealed.

### Treating It Like Omaha

In Crazy Pineapple, you end with **two hole cards**, not four. The game finishes like Hold’em, not Omaha.

### Overvaluing Weak Hands

Starting with three cards makes many hands look strong early. Not all of them stay strong after the discard.
