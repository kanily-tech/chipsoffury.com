          <h3>Objective of the game</h3>
          <p>To win the pot by having the highest ranking 5-Card Poker hand. Which of course means, that in order to play Texas Hold&#x27;em Poker, you must know <a href="#">5 Card Poker Hand Ranks</a>.</p>
          <h3>Stepwise instructions of how to play a hand</h3>
          <h4>Step 1. The blinds <strong>üôà</strong></h4>
          <p>First of all, the player to the left of the dealer places a bet on the table - called the <strong>small blind</strong>. The amount of the blind is decided before starting the game. Let&#x27;s assume for the purpose of our example, a small blind of 5 chips.</p>
          <p>The player to the left of the small blind player, also places a bet on the table - called the <strong>big blind</strong>. This is 2 times the small blind amount, i.e. 10 chips.</p>
          <div class="note_block">
            <div class="note_title">Why Blinds</div>
            <p class="note">These bets are called blinds because no one has seen their cards yet. These are mandatory bets. If you are amongst the two players sitting to the left of the dealer, you will have to put respective chips into the pot.</p>
            <p class="note">‚ùó Are you worried that you got a seat besides the dealer and are having to bet these chips!!??</p>
            <p class="note">üëâ Well, worry not. The dealer rotates to the left after every hand. So everyone will get a chance to pay the blinds. We cool?</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Step 2. Hole Cards are dealt</h4>
          <p>All players are dealt 2 cards, face down. These are called the hole cards. The player can see their own hole cards once they are dealt. If you want to have a chance at winning, don&#x27;t show your hole cards to any other player ü§≠</p>
          <div class="note_block">
            <div class="note_title">Note on dealing cards</div>
            <p class="note">Cards are dealt starting from the player to the left of the dealer button, in a clockwise direction, one at a time. If you are playing online, you don&#x27;t need to worry about card distribution anyway. Usually anyone who knows how to deal, can do the dealing. If you want to know how to deal cards, read <a href="#">how to deal cards in poker</a>.</p>

          <div class="image_caption">The state of the hand so far - Blinds in pot, Hole cards dealt</div>
          <h4>Step 3. Pre-flop round of betting</h4>
          <p>And we&#x27;re in action! The first round of bets are placed on the table. Betting starts from the player to the left of the big blind. And everyone bets in clockwise turn order. So in our example, Player 2 and Player 3 are the blinds, so Player 1 will start the round of betting. Then Player 2. Then Player 3 and so on.</p>
          <p>Now, this is a good time to understand the basic rules of betting in Poker.</p>

                  <h4>Basic Rules of Betting</h4>
                </div>
                <p class="info_title_subtext">This section is a basic overview. It is enough to get you started. But if you want a more detailed explanation, please read <a href="#">Poker Betting Rules</a>.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Betting happens in turns. Everyone gets a chance to decide whether they want to bet and how much. But there are some restrictions.</p>
              <h5>Order of betting</h5>
              <p>First of all, the order in which players make their bets is clockwise üîÉ . So if Player 1 made a bet, then the next player to bet would be Player 2 and so on (see table illustration above).</p>
              <h5>Who starts the betting in the round?</h5>
              <p>The betting is opened by the <em>first remaining player</em> to the left of the dealer. </p>
              <div class="exception_block">
                <div class="exception_title">‚ùó Exception applies to this rule in the pre-flop round<br></div>
                <p class="exception">In the pre-flop round, which is the stage we were currently talking about, the betting is opened by the player to the left of the big blind.</p>
              </div>
              <h5>What are your options when it is your turn to bet?</h5>
              <p>A player can take one of three (or sometimes four) actions</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Match the amount of chips put in by the previous player. Also called a CALL.</li>
                <li>Sometimes, a player can also choose to make a zero bet. It is called a CHECK. CHECKing is allowed either when you are opening the betting for the round, or if the previous player also checked, thus you can stay in the round by matching them without betting any more chips.</li>
                <p class="inline_note">If you think about it, CHECK is similar to CALLing the previous player. Since the previous player made a zero bet, so this becomes a special case of CALL, where you can also bet zero chips.</p>
                <div class="exception_block">
                  <div class="exception_title">‚ùó Exception applies to this rule in the pre-flop round<br></div>
                  <p class="exception">Again, the pre-flop round is a little different. The player opening the betting round is NOT allowed to CHECK. This is because the mandatory blinds have already been played. So the player must match the big blind amount to stay in the hand.</p>
                </div>
                <li>Bet even more than the previous player&#x27;s bet. Also called a RAISE.</li>
                <li>or, FOLD their cards and forfeit the hand.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note_block">
                <div class="note_title">Folding Cards</div>
                <p class="note">Cards are not folded literally into half or anything üòí. It just means that you feel you cannot win this pot, and are therefore not betting any more. When you fold, you lose any chips that you have already put into the pot in any previous bets. Fold is usually done by pushing your cards towards the center of the table without showing them to anyone.</p>
              </div>
              <h5>Valid bet amounts</h5>
              <p>So to recap, you can either <br>üëé FOLD<br>ü§ô or CALL (the previous player&#x27;s bet)<br>‚úä or RAISE<br></p>
              <p class="paragraph-6">If you choose to RAISE, there are some rules that apply -<br></p>
              <div class="formula_block">
                <p>Minimum bet to make a RAISE<br>= <span class="formula_variable">chips needed for a CALL</span> +¬†<span class="formula_variable">the minimum RAISE</span></p>
              </div>
              <p>So in our example, in pre-flop, the first player to bet is Player 1. If Player 1 wants to RAISE -<br></p>
              <p class="formula_block">Minimum bet to make a RAISE (Player 1) = <strong>10</strong> +¬†<span class="formula_variable">the minimum RAISE</span><br></p>
              <div>
                <p><em>So what is the minimum raise you ask?</em><br></p>
                <p>Minimum Raise amount is either one of<br>- The big blind amount<br>- or the previous RAISE amount<br>Whichever is bigger!<br></p>
              </div>
              <p class="formula_block">Minimum bet to make a RAISE (Player 1) = <strong>10</strong> +¬†<strong>10 </strong>=<strong> 20</strong><br></p>
              <div>
                <p><em>And since there is a minimum, is there also a maximum?</em><br></p>
                <p>The answer depends. In some games there can be rules on how much maximum you can raise. But in the most common style of play, Texas Hold&#x27;em is played with No Limits. So there is no maximum.<br></p>
                <p>One more thing though... in case you want to bet more than the min RAISE, you must do so in increments of the big blind amount. So if the bet size for min RAISE = 20, then you can increment it by multiples of 10, to bet 30, or 40, or 50 and so on. 25 chips for instance, is not a valid bet.<br></p>
                <h5>And when does the betting end?</h5>
                <p>The betting ends when all players have made at least one bet (could be either of CHECK, CALL, RAISE or FOLD) - and all players who have not FOLDED have put in same amount of chips in the pot.<br></p>
                <p>Whew! So that was a lot to digest. But don&#x27;t worry. This all becomes quite intuitive after you have played a few hands. So much so, that you will probably never have to come back to this guide again once you have played a few games. üòé<br></p>
