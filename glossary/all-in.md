term: All-In
---

Betting all of your remaining chips — you can't bet more, but you can't be forced out either.

**How all-ins work:**
- You put all your chips in the pot
- You remain in the hand to showdown (can't be bet off)
- If others bet more, a "side pot" is created that you can't win
- You can only win from each player the amount you put in

**Example:**
You have $100. Opponent has $300. You go all-in for $100. If they call, the main pot is $200. If a third player then bets $200 more, the extra goes into a side pot you can't win.

**When to go all-in:**
- You have a monster hand and want maximum value
- You're on a draw and the math works (fold equity + hand equity)
- You're short-stacked and need to take a stand
- As a bluff when your opponent is likely to fold

**"Shoving"** = going all-in
**"Snap call"** = calling an all-in immediately (usually indicates a strong hand)

Going all-in is high-risk, high-reward. Use it purposefully, not recklessly.
