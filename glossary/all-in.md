term: All-In
---

Putting all your remaining chips in the pot. Once you're all-in, you can't bet more, but you're guaranteed to see your hand out to the end.

**How it works:**
- You shove all your chips into the middle
- You stay in the hand until it's decided (no one can fold you out)
- If someone else has more money than you, a "side pot" gets created for the extra chips you can't reach
- You can only win your portion of the pot from each player based on what you contributed

**Example:**
You have $100. Your opponent has $300. You go all-in for $100. They call, making the main pot $200. A third player then bets $200 more, and that extra $200 goes into a side pot you can't win.

**Good times to go all-in:**
- You've got a really strong hand and want to get money in
- You're drawing and the odds work out in your favor
- You're short-stacked and need to make a move
- You're bluffing and think your opponent will fold

**Related terms:**
- **"Shoving"** means going all-in
- **"Snap call"** means calling an all-in right away, usually showing a strong hand

Going all-in is risky but can pay off big. The key is making it count, not just pushing chips around.
