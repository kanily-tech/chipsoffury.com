term: Outs
---

Cards that haven't been dealt yet that would complete your hand.

**Example:** You have 7♠ 8♠ and the board shows 9♠ T♣ 2♠. You need a spade for a flush or a 6/J for a straight.
- **Flush outs:** 9 spades left (13 total minus 4 you've seen)
- **Straight outs:** 4 sixes + 4 jacks = 8 cards

**Fast way to estimate your odds:**
- Multiply your outs by **2** to get roughly your % chance on the river
- Multiply your outs by **4** to get roughly your % chance if two cards come

So 9 outs is about 18% to hit on the next card, or 36% if you see both turn and river.

When you're deciding whether to call with a drawing hand, count your outs first. More outs means better pot odds needed to play.
