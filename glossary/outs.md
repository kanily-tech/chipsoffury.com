term: Outs
---

Cards remaining in the deck that will complete your hand.

**Example:** You have 7♠ 8♠ and the board shows 9♠ T♣ 2♠. You need a spade for a flush or a 6/J for a straight.
- **Flush outs:** 9 spades remain (13 - 4 you see)
- **Straight outs:** 4 sixes + 4 jacks = 8 cards

**Quick math (Rule of 2 and 4):**
- Multiply outs by **2** for your % chance on the next card
- Multiply outs by **4** for your % chance with two cards to come

So 9 outs = ~18% on one card, ~36% with two cards to come.

Counting outs correctly is the foundation of deciding whether to call, raise, or fold with drawing hands.
