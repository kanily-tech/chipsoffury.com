term: River
---

The fifth and final community card in Hold'em — and the last betting round before showdown.

**The sequence:**
1. Preflop → 2. Flop (3 cards) → 3. Turn (4th card) → 4. **River (5th card)**

**Why the river matters:**
- No more cards to come — your hand is final
- No more drawing — you either hit or you didn't
- Biggest bets typically happen here
- Bluffs are most expensive (and riskiest) on the river

**Common river situations:**
- **Value betting:** You have a strong hand and want a call
- **Bluff-catching:** You have a medium hand deciding if opponent is bluffing
- **Giving up:** Your draw missed and you fold to aggression

**The origin:**
The term comes from riverboat gambling in 19th-century America. Some say cheaters would "deal off the river" (wait until the boat reached the river to deal the final card) to avoid getting caught.

**"Rivered"** means an opponent hit their card on the river to beat you — usually when you were ahead until that final card.
