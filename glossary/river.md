term: River
---

The fifth and final community card in Hold'em. Once the river hits, no more cards come, and the hand either goes to showdown or someone wins it right there.

**The sequence:**
1. Preflop → 2. Flop (3 cards) → 3. Turn (4th card) → 4. **River (5th card)**

**Why it matters:**
- Your hand is locked in. No more chances to improve
- This is where big decisions happen. The biggest bets often come on the river
- If you were on a draw, this card either saves you or ends your night

**What happens on the river:**
- **Value betting:** You hit something strong and want your opponent to call
- **Bluff-catching:** You think your opponent might be bluffing and you're deciding whether to call
- **Folding:** Your draw missed and you're out

**Where the name comes from:**
Riverboat gamblers in 19th-century America. Some cheaters allegedly would wait until the boat reached the river before dealing the final card to reduce their chances of getting caught.

**Being "rivered"** means your opponent caught their card on the river to beat you. Usually feels bad because you were winning the entire hand.
