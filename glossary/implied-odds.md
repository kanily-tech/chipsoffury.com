term: Implied Odds
---

The extra money you expect to win if you hit your hand on later streets.

Pot odds look at what's in the pot right now. Implied odds add in what your opponent will probably pay you later when your draw hits.

**Example:** The pot is $50, your opponent bets $25, and you have a flush draw (about 35% to hit). Straight pot odds say you need 25% equity to call, and your 35% gets you there. But here's the thing.

If you hit your flush and your opponent's got a solid hand, they'll probably call another $75 on the next street. Now you're risking $25 to win $150 total (the current pot plus what they'll likely call). That's 6:1 implied odds.

**Implied odds are great when:**
- Your opponent has a strong hand but it's second-best to yours
- Both of you have plenty of chips left
- Your draw is hidden (they won't suspect it)

**Implied odds are bad when:**
- Your opponent folds easily to aggression
- You're both running short on chips
- The board is obvious about what you're drawing to
