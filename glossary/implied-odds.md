term: Implied Odds
---

The additional money you expect to win on future streets if you complete your draw.

Regular pot odds only consider what's in the pot now. Implied odds factor in what your opponent will likely pay you later.

**Example:** The pot is $50, you face a $25 bet, and you have a flush draw (35% to hit). Direct pot odds are 3:1, needing 25% equity. Your 35% is enough — but it gets better.

If you hit your flush and your opponent has a strong hand, they might call another $75 on later streets. Now you're really risking $25 to win $150 (the current pot + their future calls). That's 6:1 implied odds.

**When implied odds are high:**
- Opponent has a strong but second-best hand
- Deep stacks (more money left to win)
- Your draw is disguised (they won't see it coming)

**When implied odds are low:**
- Opponent is tight and will fold to aggression
- Short stacks (not much left to extract)
- Board is scary (they'll see the flush completed)
