term: Preflop
---

The first betting round in Hold'em, before any community cards are dealt.

**What happens preflop:**
1. Blinds are posted
2. Each player gets two hole cards
3. Betting starts with the player left of the big blind (UTG)
4. Players fold, call, or raise
5. Action continues until all bets are matched

**Why it matters:**
- Which hands you start with shapes your profit over time
- Your position at the table determines what hands you can play
- Raises give you the upper hand for the rest of the hand
- Most hands end preflop because someone folds

**Basic preflop strategy:**
- Play tight early in position, looser when you're late
- Raise or fold. Don't limp (just call the big blind)
- Respect raises from tight players in early position
- Steal the blinds from late position when the table folds to you

Professional players fold 70-80% of their hands preflop. If you're folding less than that, you're probably playing too many hands.
