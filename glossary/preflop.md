term: Preflop
---

The first betting round in Hold'em — before any community cards are dealt.

**What happens preflop:**
1. Blinds are posted
2. Each player receives two hole cards
3. Betting starts with the player left of the big blind (UTG)
4. Players fold, call, or raise
5. Action continues until all bets are matched

**Why preflop matters:**
- Your starting hand selection determines much of your long-term profit
- Position relative to the blinds affects which hands you can play
- Raises establish initiative for the rest of the hand
- Most hands end preflop (someone folds)

**Preflop strategy basics:**
- Play tight from early position, wider from late position
- Raise or fold — don't limp (just call the big blind)
- Respect raises from tight players in early position
- Steal the blinds from late position when folded to you

Professional players fold **70-80% of their hands preflop**. If you're folding less, you're probably playing too loose.
