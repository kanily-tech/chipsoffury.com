term: Hole Cards
---

The two private cards dealt face-down to each player at the start of a hand. Only you can see them.

**Also called:** pocket cards, down cards, or simply "your hand"

These cards are what separate your hand from everyone else's. They're hidden, so your opponents can't use them against you until showdown.

**Types of hole cards:**
- **Pocket pair:** Two cards of the same rank (e.g., 7♠ 7♥)
- **Suited:** Two cards of the same suit (e.g., A♠ K♠)
- **Offsuit:** Two cards of different suits (e.g., A♠ K♥)
- **Connectors:** Two sequential cards (e.g., 9♠ 8♥)
- **Suited connectors:** Sequential cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠)

At showdown, you combine your two hole cards with the five community cards to make the best five-card hand. You can use both, one, or neither of your hole cards.

**"I had pocket aces"** means your hole cards were A♠ A♥ (or any two aces).
