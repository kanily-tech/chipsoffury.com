term: Hole Cards
---

The two private cards dealt face-down to each player at the start of a hand — only you can see them.

**Also called:** pocket cards, down cards, or simply "your hand"

**Why hole cards matter:**
- They're the only cards that distinguish your hand from opponents'
- Hidden information creates the deception that makes poker poker
- Strong hole cards + favorable community cards = winning hands

**Common hole card terminology:**
- **Pocket pair:** Two cards of the same rank (e.g., 7♠ 7♥)
- **Suited:** Two cards of the same suit (e.g., A♠ K♠)
- **Offsuit:** Two cards of different suits (e.g., A♠ K♥)
- **Connectors:** Two sequential cards (e.g., 9♠ 8♥)
- **Suited connectors:** Sequential and same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠)

**At showdown**, you combine your two hole cards with the five community cards to make the best possible five-card hand. You can use both, one, or neither of your hole cards.

**"I had pocket aces"** means "my hole cards were A♠ A♥" (or any two aces).
