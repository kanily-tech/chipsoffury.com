term: Calling Station
---

A player who calls too often and almost never folds — they want to see showdowns regardless of the odds.

**Characteristics:**
- Calls bets with weak hands hoping to "catch up"
- Rarely raises even with strong hands
- Chases draws without considering pot odds
- Hates folding — they paid to see their cards, so they'll play them

**How to beat a calling station:**
1. **Don't bluff** — they'll call anyway
2. **Value bet relentlessly** — they'll pay you off with worse hands
3. **Bet your strong hands bigger** — they're not folding
4. **Give up on weak hands** — you can't move them off pots

**The silver lining:**
Calling stations are profitable opponents in the long run. They call too much with losing hands. Your job is simple: make strong hands and bet them.

The term is slightly derogatory — it implies a player who doesn't understand bet sizing or hand selection. But at low stakes, calling stations often fund the entire table.
