term: Calling Station
---

A player who calls too often and almost never folds. They want to see every showdown, no matter what the odds say.

**What they do:**
- Calls bets with weak hands, hoping to catch up
- Rarely raises, even with strong hands
- Chases draws without thinking about pot odds
- Won't fold once they've put money in the pot

**How to beat them:**
1. **Stop bluffing** - they'll just call anyway
2. **Bet your good hands for value** - they'll pay you off with worse
3. **Make your strong hands bigger** - they're not going anywhere
4. **Give up on weak hands** - you won't push them off the pot

**Why they're great for you:**
Calling stations are money machines long-term. They call too much with hands that lose. Your strategy is simple: make solid hands and bet them.

It's a derogatory term that suggests a player doesn't really understand bet sizing or which hands to play. But at low stakes, calling stations basically keep the whole table in business.
