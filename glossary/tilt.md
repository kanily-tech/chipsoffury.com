term: Tilt
---

A state of emotional frustration that causes you to play worse than you normally would - usually too aggressive, too loose, or just reckless.

**What sets it off:**
- Bad beats (losing when you were the favorite)
- A run of bad hands
- Getting bluffed or outplayed
- Stress or anger you brought to the table

**How to spot it:**
- Playing hands you'd normally fold
- Making "revenge" calls or raises
- Thinking "I'm due for a win"
- Feeling annoyed at specific players or the dealer

The term comes from pinball - physically tilting the machine causes it to lock up and flash "TILT."

**How to handle it:** Notice it early, take a break, or leave the session. Walking away isn't weakness. It saves money.
