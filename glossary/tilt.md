term: Tilt
---

A state of emotional frustration that causes you to play worse than you normally would — typically too aggressive, too loose, or just reckless.

**Common triggers:**
- Bad beats (losing when you were the favorite)
- A string of unlucky hands
- Getting bluffed or outplayed
- External stress brought to the table

**Warning signs you're tilting:**
- Playing hands you'd normally fold
- Making "revenge" calls or raises
- Thinking "I'm due for a win"
- Feeling angry at specific players or the dealer

The term comes from pinball — physically tilting the machine causes it to lock up and flash "TILT."

**The fix:** Recognize it early, take a break, or quit the session entirely. No shame in walking away — it saves money.
