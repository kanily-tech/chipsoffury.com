term: Semi-Bluff
---

A bet or raise with a drawing hand that's not currently best but has a good chance to improve.

**Example:** You have 8♠ 9♠ on a board of 7♠ T♣ 2♠. You don't have a made hand yet, but you have both a flush draw and an open-ended straight draw. Betting here is a semi-bluff.

**Why semi-bluffs are powerful:**
You can win two ways:
1. **Opponent folds** — you take the pot immediately with nothing
2. **Opponent calls** — you still have strong equity to make the best hand

A pure bluff has no backup plan. A semi-bluff gives you outs if called.

**Best semi-bluffing hands:**
- Flush draws (9 outs)
- Open-ended straight draws (8 outs)
- Combination draws (flush + straight potential)

Semi-bluffing is most effective when you have position, the board favors your range, and your opponent shows weakness.
