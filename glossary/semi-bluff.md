term: Semi-Bluff
---

A bet or raise with a hand that isn't the strongest right now but could improve.

**Example:** You hold 8♠ 9♠ and the board shows 7♠ T♣ 2♠. You're not ahead yet, but you have a flush draw and an open-ended straight draw. Betting here is a semi-bluff.

**Why it works:** You win in two ways. If your opponent folds, you take the pot right there. If they call, you still have 8-9 cards that make you the winner.

This is different from a pure bluff, where you have nothing and need your opponent to fold. A semi-bluff always has a backup plan.

**Good hands for semi-bluffing:**
- Flush draws (9 outs)
- Open-ended straight draws (8 outs)
- Combination draws (both flush and straight potential)
