term: Three-Bet
---

A re-raise over an initial raise — the third aggressive action preflop.

**The sequence:**
1. **Bet 1:** Posting the big blind (forced)
2. **Bet 2:** The first raise
3. **Bet 3:** A re-raise over that raise = the three-bet

**Example:** In a $1/$2 game, a player raises to $8. You look down at Q♠ Q♥ and re-raise to $24. That's a three-bet.

**Why three-bet:**
- Build bigger pots with premium hands
- Isolate weaker hands that would've called a single raise
- Represent strength and take the initiative
- Sometimes as a bluff to steal pots preflop

**Common three-betting hands:**
- Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ)
- Strong broadway hands (AK, AQ)
- Occasionally suited connectors or small pairs as bluffs (advanced)

A "four-bet" is a re-raise over a three-bet — typically signals a very strong hand.
