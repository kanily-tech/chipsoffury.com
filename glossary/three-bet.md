---
term: Three-Bet
---

A re-raise over an initial raise. It's the third betting action preflop.

Here's how it works:
1. Someone posts the big blind (forced)
2. A player raises
3. You re-raise over that raise - that's your three-bet

**Example:** $1/$2 game. A player raises to $8. You've got Q♠ Q♥ and re-raise to $24. That's a three-bet.

**Why you'd three-bet:**
- Get more money in the pot with strong hands
- Kick out weaker hands that would just call a single raise
- Show you've got something and take control
- Sometimes bluff to win the pot right there

**Hands worth three-betting:**
- Premium pairs like AA, KK, QQ, JJ
- Strong broadway cards like AK, AQ
- Occasionally small pairs or suited connectors as bluffs (once you know what you're doing)

A "four-bet" is a re-raise after your three-bet. Usually means someone's holding something really strong.
