term: C-Bet
---

Short for "continuation bet" - a bet on the flop by the player who raised before the flop.

**Example:** You raise preflop with A♠ K♦, someone calls. The flop comes 8♥ 5♣ 2♦ and you whiffed. You bet anyway. That's a c-bet.

**Why they work:**
- You already raised preflop, so your bet makes sense
- Most flops miss your opponent about 2 out of 3 times
- You're continuing the story you started before the flop

**When to c-bet:**
- Dry boards (few draws) where your hand looks strong
- When you're heads-up against one opponent
- When you have position

**When to skip it:**
- Multi-way pots where someone likely hit something
- Wet boards full of draws
- When the flop heavily favors your opponent's likely hands

C-bet too much and you're predictable. Mix it up and you keep people guessing.
