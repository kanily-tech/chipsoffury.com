term: C-Bet
---

Short for "continuation bet" — a bet on the flop by the player who raised preflop, continuing their aggression.

**Example:** You raise preflop with A♠ K♦, one player calls. The flop comes 8♥ 5♣ 2♦ — you missed completely. Betting here anyway is a c-bet.

**Why c-bets work:**
- You represented strength by raising preflop
- Your opponent misses the flop about 2/3 of the time
- Betting follows through on your story

**When to c-bet:**
- Dry boards (few draws) that favor your range
- Heads-up pots (one opponent)
- When you have position

**When to check instead:**
- Multi-way pots (someone likely connected)
- Wet boards with many draws
- When you have a very weak hand and the board hits your opponent's range

C-betting too often makes you predictable. C-betting selectively keeps opponents guessing.
