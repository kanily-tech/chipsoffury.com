term: Check-Raise
---

Checking to an opponent with the intention of raising after they bet.

**Example:** You're first to act with a strong hand. You check, your opponent bets $30, and you raise to $90. That's a check-raise.

**Why check-raise:**
- Build bigger pots with strong hands
- Trap aggressive opponents who bet when checked to
- Balance your checking range (so checks don't always mean weakness)
- It's your main weapon when out of position

**When to check-raise:**
- You have a very strong hand and expect aggression
- The board favors your range and you want to represent strength
- As a semi-bluff with a strong draw

**The psychology:**
Check-raises feel aggressive and can put opponents on tilt. Showing this move occasionally makes opponents hesitant to bet into you — which gives your legitimate checks more respect.

Some older home games consider check-raising "poor etiquette." In serious poker, it's a fundamental play.
