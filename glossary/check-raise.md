term: Check-Raise
---

You check, someone bets, then you raise them. That's a check-raise.

**Example:** You're in position with top pair. You check, your opponent bets $30, and you raise to $90.

**Why use it:**
- Win bigger pots when you're holding strong hands
- Trap aggressive players who bet after you check
- Keep opponents guessing what your check means (not always weakness)
- Your best move when you're out of position

**Good spots:**
- You have a strong hand and expect your opponent to bet
- The board is good for your holdings and you want to show strength
- You have a strong draw and want to build the pot right now

**The mind game:**
Check-raises are aggressive. They can frustrate opponents and make them second-guess betting into you next time. Some older home games treat it as rude, but in real poker it's a basic strategy tool.
