term: Limp
---

Calling the big blind preflop instead of raising — entering the pot passively.

**Example:** The blinds are $1/$2. A player in middle position calls $2 (rather than raising to $6-$8). That's a limp.

**Why limping is usually bad:**
1. **No initiative** — A raiser can win by making everyone fold. A limper can't.
2. **Signals weakness** — Good players will raise behind you to attack your passive range.
3. **Multi-way pots** — Limping encourages others to limp, creating pots with many players where your hand equity drops.

**The raise-or-fold principle:**
If a hand is worth playing, it's worth raising. If it's not worth raising, fold it.

**Exception — the big blind:**
When everyone limps to you in the big blind, you get to see a flop for free. You're already in — no limp required.

**"Open limping"** (being the first to limp) is especially weak. "Overlimping" (limping after others have limped) is slightly less bad, but still passive play that loses money long-term.
