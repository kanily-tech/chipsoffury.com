term: Limp
---

Calling the big blind preflop instead of raising. You're entering the pot passively.

**Example:** The blinds are $1/$2. A player in middle position calls $2 instead of raising to $6-$8. That's a limp.

**Why limping usually loses money:**
1. **No initiative** - A raiser can win the pot right there by making everyone fold. A limper can't.
2. **You look weak** - Smart players will raise you to attack your passive range.
3. **Multi-way pots** - Limping invites others to limp, creating pots with many players where your hand value drops.

**The raise-or-fold principle:**
If a hand is good enough to play, it's good enough to raise with. If you wouldn't raise it, fold it.

**Exception - the big blind:**
When everyone limps to you in the big blind, you're already partially in the pot. You can check and see the flop for free. That's not technically a limp.

**Open limping** (being the first to limp) is especially weak. **Overlimping** (limping after others have limped) is less bad, but you're still playing passively and losing money over time.
