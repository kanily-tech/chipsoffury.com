term: Expected Value
---

The average result of a decision if you made it thousands of times — often abbreviated as "EV."

**The formula:**
(% chance of winning × amount won) − (% chance of losing × amount lost)

**Example:**
You call a $50 bet with a flush draw. You hit 35% of the time and win $200 when you do. You miss 65% of the time and lose your $50.

EV = (0.35 × $200) − (0.65 × $50) = $70 − $32.50 = **+$37.50**

This call has positive expected value. Over many repetitions, you profit.

**Why EV matters:**
- **+EV decisions** make money long-term (keep making them)
- **−EV decisions** lose money long-term (stop making them)
- Short-term results don't tell you if a decision was correct

**The mindset shift:**
You can make the right decision and lose. You can make the wrong decision and win. EV tells you which decisions are profitable over time — regardless of how any single hand plays out.
