term: Expected Value
---

The average result of a decision if you made it thousands of times. Usually shortened to "EV."

**The formula:**
(% chance of winning × amount won) - (% chance of losing × amount lost)

**Example:**
You call a $50 bet with a flush draw. You hit 35% of the time and win $200. You miss 65% of the time and lose your $50.

EV = (0.35 × $200) - (0.65 × $50) = $70 - $32.50 = **+$37.50**

This call has positive expected value. Do it enough times, and you profit.

**Why it matters:**
- **+EV decisions** make money over time (keep doing them)
- **-EV decisions** lose money over time (stop doing them)
- One hand result won't tell you if a decision was right or wrong

**The real lesson:**
You can make the right decision and lose a hand. You can make the wrong decision and win one. EV tells you which decisions are actually profitable. Your single hand result doesn't matter.
