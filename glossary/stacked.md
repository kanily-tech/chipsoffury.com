term: Stacked
---

Losing all your chips to another player in a single hand. Getting "stacked" means someone took your entire stack.

**Example:**
You buy in for $100. Your opponent flops a set against your overpair, you can't get away from it, and all $100 ends up in front of them. You just got stacked.

**Related terms:**
- **"Felted"** means the same thing - your chips are gone and all that's left is the felt
- Going **all-in** is the action; getting stacked is the result when you lose
