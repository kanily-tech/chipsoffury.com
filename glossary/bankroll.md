term: Bankroll
---

The money you set aside just for poker.

A good bankroll is:
- **Kept separate** from the money you need for bills and life
- **Big enough** to handle losing streaks without going broke

Most players keep **20-30 buy-ins** for the stakes they play at. So if you're playing $1/$2, that's $40-$60 total.
