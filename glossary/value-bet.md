term: Value Bet
---

A bet made with a strong hand, hoping to get called by worse hands.

**Example:** You have A♠ K♠ on a board of A♣ 9♥ 4♦ 2♠ 7♣. You bet $50 into a $60 pot. Why? You expect hands like A-Q, A-J, or even A-T to call — and you beat all of them.

**The opposite of a bluff:**
- **Bluff:** You want opponents to fold
- **Value bet:** You want opponents to call

**Key principles:**
- Bet an amount worse hands will call
- Size up against calling stations who pay off too much
- Size down against tight players who fold marginal hands
- Don't bet so big that only better hands call

**Value betting is where most of your profit comes from.** Bluffs are exciting, but steady value extraction from weaker hands is what builds your bankroll over time.

"Thin value" means betting with a hand that only barely beats your opponent's likely calling range — advanced play that requires accurate hand reading.
