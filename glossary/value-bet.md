term: Value Bet
---

A bet made with a strong hand, hoping to get called by worse hands.

**Example:** You have A♠ K♠ on a board of A♣ 9♥ 4♦ 2♠ 7♣. You bet $50 into a $60 pot. Why? You expect hands like A-Q, A-J, or even A-T to call - and you beat all of them.

**The opposite of a bluff:**
- **Bluff:** You want opponents to fold
- **Value bet:** You want opponents to call

**How to size it right:**
- Bet an amount worse hands will actually call
- Go bigger against players who pay off loose calls
- Go smaller against tight players who fold with weak hands
- Don't bet so much that only hands better than yours call

**This is where real poker money comes from.** Bluffs are fun to talk about, but the steady profit comes from getting paid when you have the best hand.

"Thin value" means betting with a hand that barely beats what your opponent will call with. It's advanced stuff and takes good hand reading to pull off.
