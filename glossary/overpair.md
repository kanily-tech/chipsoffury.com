term: Overpair
---

A pocket pair that's higher than any card on the board.

**Example:** You have K♠ K♥ and the board shows J♦ 8♣ 3♠. Your kings are an overpair — they beat any single pair your opponent could make with the board.

**Why overpairs are valuable:**
- You have a made hand from the flop
- You're ahead of top pair (their best possible one-pair hand)
- Your hand is disguised — opponents can't see you have a pair

**The danger:**
Overpairs can be tricky because:
- You beat one pair but lose to two pair, sets, straights, and flushes
- As the board develops, more hands can beat you
- Strong opponents know you could have an overpair and will slow-play monsters against you

**Hierarchy:**
- AA on a K-high board: best possible overpair
- KK on a Q-high board: strong overpair
- JJ on a T-high board: vulnerable overpair (any Q, K, or A is scary)

With an overpair, bet for value but stay alert to signs you're beaten.
