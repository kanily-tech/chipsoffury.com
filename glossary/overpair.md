term: Overpair
---

A pocket pair that's higher than any card on the board.

**Example:** You have K♠ K♥ and the board shows J♦ 8♣ 3♠. Your kings are an overpair - they beat any single pair your opponent could make with the board.

**Why they matter:**
- You have a made hand right from the flop
- You're ahead of top pair (the best one-pair hand they can make)
- Your hand is invisible - opponents don't know you have a pair in your pocket

**The catch:**
Overpairs look great until they don't. You crush one pair but lose to two pair, sets, straights, and flushes. As more cards come out, more hands beat you. Good players also know you might have an overpair and will trap you with stronger hands.

**In the pecking order:**
- AA on a K-high board: the best overpair
- KK on a Q-high board: pretty strong
- JJ on a T-high board: shaky (Q, K, or A hitting the board is bad news)

Bet for value with an overpair, but keep your eyes open.
