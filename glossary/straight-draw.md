term: Straight Draw
---

A hand with four cards to a straight, needing one more to complete it.

**Two types:**

**Open-Ended Straight Draw (OESD):**
Four consecutive cards that can complete on either end.
- Example: You have 7-8 and the board shows 9-T. Either a 6 or a J completes your straight.
- **8 outs** (four 6s + four Js)
- ~32% chance to hit by the river

**Gutshot (Inside Straight Draw):**
Four cards with a gap in the middle — only one rank completes it.
- Example: You have 7-8 and the board shows 5-T. Only a 9 completes your straight.
- **4 outs** (four 9s)
- ~17% chance to hit by the river

**Playing straight draws:**
- Open-ended draws are strong semi-bluffing hands
- Gutshots are weaker — need better pot odds or implied odds
- Be aware of "wet" boards that give opponents better draws

**"Double gutshot"** = two different cards can complete your straight (like a gutshot that works two ways). Same odds as an OESD.
