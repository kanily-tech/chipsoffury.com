term: Straight Draw
---

You have four cards to a straight and need one more card to complete it.

**Open-Ended Straight Draw (OESD):**
Four consecutive cards where either end can complete the straight.
- Example: You have 7-8 and the board shows 9-T. A 6 or J finishes your straight.
- **8 outs** (four of each)
- About 32% chance to hit by the river

**Gutshot (Inside Straight Draw):**
Four cards with a gap in the middle. Only one specific rank completes the straight.
- Example: You have 7-8 and the board shows 5-T. Only a 9 finishes it.
- **4 outs**
- About 17% chance to hit by the river

**Why this matters:**
- Open-ended draws are worth playing most of the time - you have decent odds to win
- Gutshots are tougher - you need better pot odds to make the bet worth it
- Watch for boards where your opponent has an even better draw

**"Double gutshot"** has two different cards that complete your straight (like two separate gutshots at once). It has the same odds as an open-ended draw.
