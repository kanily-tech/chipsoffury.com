term: Showdown
---

When everyone stops betting and reveals their cards to see who has the best hand.

Here's what actually happens: the last person who bet or raised shows their cards first, then everyone else reveals. You make your best five-card hand using your two hole cards plus the five community cards on the board. Highest hand wins the pot. If two hands are identical, you split it.

You don't have to show your cards if you fold before anyone goes all-in. So if everyone else reveals and you know you're beat, just muck your hand and move on.

Not every hand goes to showdown. Sometimes everyone folds and one player wins without anyone seeing the cards. That's a non-showdown win.

You'll see "WTSD" in poker stats sometimes. It stands for "went to showdown" and shows how often you actually reach this point. If your WTSD is really high, you're probably calling too much. Too low and you might be folding under pressure too easily.
