term: Showdown
---

When two or more players remain after the final betting round and reveal their cards to determine the winner.

**How it works:**
1. All remaining players show their hole cards
2. Each player makes their best five-card hand from their two hole cards plus the five community cards
3. The best hand wins the pot
4. If hands are exactly equal, the pot is split

**Showdown rules:**
- The last aggressor (player who bet or raised) typically shows first
- Other players can "muck" (fold without showing) if they know they're beaten
- In most games, any player can request to see a called hand

**"Going to showdown"** vs. **"Winning without showdown":**
- Showdown wins = you had the best hand
- Non-showdown wins = everyone folded before the river ended

**WTSD (Went to Showdown)** is a poker statistic measuring how often you reach showdown. Too high means you're calling too much; too low might mean you're folding to pressure too often.
