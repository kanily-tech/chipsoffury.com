term: Showdown

The final reveal. When all betting is done and two or more players are still in the hand, everyone shows their cards to see who wins.

**Where it fits:**

**Who shows first?** The player who made the last bet or raise on the river. If everyone checked, it starts with the first player to the left of the dealer button.

**Do I have to show if I lose?** No. Once you see an opponent's winning hand, you can "muck" (fold without showing). Many players do this to hide information about what they were playing.

**Tip for beginners:** Just flip your cards over and let the dealer figure out who wins. Beginners sometimes misread their hands and muck winners by accident. The dealer won't let that happen if your cards are face-up.

**Don't slow roll.** If you have the winning hand, show it promptly. Making your opponent wait while you pretend to think about it is considered rude. Just flip your cards over.

Not every hand reaches showdown - often everyone folds and one player wins without revealing anything.
