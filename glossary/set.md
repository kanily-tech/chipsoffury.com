Three of a kind when you hold a pocket pair and one matching card hits the board.

**Example:** You have 7♥ 7♦ and the board comes K♠ 7♣ 2♦. That's a set of sevens.

**Set vs. Trips:**
- **Set:** Your pocket pair + one on board (harder to spot, way better)
- **Trips:** One of your cards + two on board (easier to see coming)

Sets win more money because opponents can't figure out what you're holding. Plus, even if the board pairs, you've got a full house waiting. Guys holding top pair get crushed trying to make you fold.

**The reality:** You'll flop a set about 1 in 8 times when you start with a pocket pair.

That's why small pairs matter. You don't win big every time - you lose 7 out of 8 flops - but when you hit, the hand pays off huge.
