term: Set

Three of a kind when you hold a pocket pair and the board provides the third matching card.

**Example:** You have 7♥ 7♦ and the board comes K♠ 7♣ 2♦. You've flopped a set of sevens.

**Set vs. Trips:**
- **Set:** Pocket pair + one on board (stronger, more disguised)
- **Trips:** One card in your hand + two on board (weaker, more obvious)

Sets are more valuable because:
1. They're harder for opponents to detect
2. You have a stronger full house redraw (your pair fills up)
3. Opponents with top pair often pay you off

**The math:** You'll flop a set with a pocket pair about **12% of the time** (roughly 1 in 8 flops).

This is why small pairs are speculative hands — their main value comes from set-mining, and you miss 7 times out of 8.
