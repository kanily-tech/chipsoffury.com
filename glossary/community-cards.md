term: Community Cards
---

The cards dealt face-up in the center of the table that every player uses to build their hand.

**In Texas Hold'em:**
- **Flop:** 3 community cards dealt first
- **Turn:** 1 more card added
- **River:** 1 final card added
- **Total:** 5 community cards

**How it works:**
- All players see the exact same cards
- You combine your two hole cards with the five community cards to make the best possible five-card hand
- You can use both of your cards, one, or neither

**"The board"** = the community cards
- "The board is A-K-Q-7-2" means those five cards are showing
- "The board paired" means two of those cards have the same rank

**Why this matters:**
Everyone sees the same cards, so when a scary card comes out (an ace, a third card of the same suit, or a card that completes a straight), you and your opponents all know about it. Learning how cards on the board change the strength of different hands is where real poker strategy starts.
