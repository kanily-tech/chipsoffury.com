term: Community Cards
---

The shared cards dealt face-up in the center of the table — all players use them to make their hands.

**In Texas Hold'em:**
- **Flop:** 3 community cards dealt together
- **Turn:** 1 community card added
- **River:** 1 final community card added
- **Total:** 5 community cards

**How they work:**
- Every player sees the same community cards
- You combine your two hole cards with the five community cards
- You make the best five-card hand from these seven cards
- You can use any combination — both hole cards, one, or neither

**"The board"** = the community cards
- "The board is A-K-Q-7-2" means those are the five community cards
- "The board paired" means two community cards share the same rank

**Why community cards matter:**
They create shared information. When a dangerous card hits (an ace, a third suited card, a straight-completing card), both you and your opponent see it. Reading how the board affects different hand ranges is a key poker skill.
