term: Blinds
---

Forced bets that two players put in before cards are dealt. They give everyone a reason to play the hand.

**The two blinds:**
- **Small blind (SB):** Posted by the player directly left of the dealer button, usually half the big blind
- **Big blind (BB):** Posted by the next player left. This sets the minimum bet for the round

**Example:** In a $1/$2 game, the small blind posts $1 and the big blind posts $2. To stay in the hand, everyone else needs to put in at least $2.

**Why they exist:**
If there were no blinds, players would just fold every hand until they got pocket aces. Blinds force action and make sure there's always something to win.

The dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, so everyone takes turns posting the blinds over time.
