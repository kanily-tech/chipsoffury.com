term: Blinds
---

Forced bets posted before any cards are dealt, creating a pot worth fighting for.

**The two blinds:**
- **Small blind (SB):** Posted by the player directly left of the dealer button — typically half the big blind
- **Big blind (BB):** Posted by the next player left — sets the minimum bet for the round

**Example:** In a $1/$2 game, the small blind posts $1 and the big blind posts $2. Any player wanting to enter the pot must at least match the $2.

**Why blinds exist:**
Without them, everyone could fold until they got pocket aces. Blinds force action and create something to win in every hand.

The dealer button (and thus the blinds) moves one seat clockwise after each hand, so everyone pays equally over time.
