term: Range
---

The collection of all possible hands a player could have in a given situation.

**Example:** A tight player raises from early position. Their range might be: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ. Not "they have AK" — they could have any of these hands.

**Why thinking in ranges matters:**
- You can never know their exact hand
- Each action narrows their range
- Your decisions should beat their entire range, not just one specific hand

**Range narrowing in action:**
1. Player raises preflop → Range includes all raising hands
2. They c-bet a dry flop → Range still wide
3. They bet big on a blank turn → Range narrows to strong hands
4. They shove the river → Range is mostly monsters

**The shift from hand reading to range reading** is one of the biggest leaps in poker development. Beginners guess "he has AK." Intermediate players think "his range is weighted toward big pairs and strong aces." Advanced players assign percentages to every hand in the range.

Start simple: does their range contain mostly strong hands, mostly draws, or a mix?
