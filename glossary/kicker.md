term: Kicker
---

The side card that wins the hand when both players have the same main hand.

**Example:** You have A♠ K♥ and your opponent has A♦ 9♣. The board is A♣ 7♠ 5♦ 4♥ 2♣. You both have a pair of aces, but your king kicker beats their nine kicker.

Your best five: A-A-K-7-5
Their best five: A-A-9-7-5
**You win.**

**Real impact:**
- Same pair? The higher kicker wins
- Two pair or trips? The remaining cards decide it
- "Out-kicked" means you lost because your side card was weaker

**The beginner mistake:**
Hands like A-4 or K-7 feel playable because you have high cards. Then you hit top pair and lose to the exact same pair with a better kicker. Getting "dominated" this way costs beginners real money.

**Quick tip:** Play hands with strong kickers (A-K, A-Q, K-Q) and skip the weak ones (A-5, K-8).
