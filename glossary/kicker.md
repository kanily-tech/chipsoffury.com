term: Kicker
---

The side card that breaks ties when players have the same hand type.

**Example:** You have A♠ K♥ and your opponent has A♦ 9♣. The board is A♣ 7♠ 5♦ 4♥ 2♣. You both have a pair of aces, but your king kicker beats their nine kicker.

Your best five: A-A-K-7-5
Their best five: A-A-9-7-5
**You win.**

**Why kickers matter:**
- With the same pair, the higher kicker wins
- With two pair or trips, the remaining cards can still break ties
- "Out-kicked" means losing because your side card is weaker

**The beginner trap:**
Hands like A-4 or K-7 look playable because they have high cards. But when you hit top pair, you often lose to the same top pair with a better kicker. This is called being "dominated" — and it costs beginners a lot of money.

**Rule of thumb:** Play hands with high kickers (A-K, A-Q, K-Q) and avoid weak-kicker trouble hands (A-5, K-8).
