term: Equity
---

Your percentage chance of winning a hand, often expressed as your "share" of the pot.

**Example:** You have A♠ K♠ and your opponent has 7♥ 7♦. Before any community cards, you have about 47% equity — roughly a coin flip.

**Why it matters:**
- Equity helps you decide whether to call, raise, or fold
- Compare your equity to the pot odds being offered
- If your equity exceeds the break-even percentage, calling is profitable

**Common equities to know:**
- Premium pair vs. underpair (AA vs. 77): ~80% vs. ~20%
- Pair vs. two overcards (77 vs. AK): ~55% vs. ~45%
- Flush draw on the flop: ~35% to hit by the river

Equity isn't fixed — it changes as community cards are dealt.
