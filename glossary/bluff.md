term: Bluff
---

Betting or raising with a weak hand, hoping your opponent will fold a better hand.

**Example:** You have 6♠ 7♠ on a board of A♣ K♥ 8♦ 2♠ 3♣. You have nothing - but you bet big, acting like you have an ace. If your opponent folds their pocket jacks, you win with the worst hand.

**Why bluffs work:**
- Your opponent can't see your cards
- A big bet looks strong
- Players fold hands they're unsure about

**When to bluff:**
- Against players who fold easily
- When the board could fit your story
- When you have some way to improve if they call
- When your betting makes sense for your position

**When NOT to bluff:**
- Against players who call everything
- In pots with multiple players (someone probably has something)
- Right after you got caught bluffing

**Beginner tip:** Bluff less often than you think. Most casual players call way too much, so your actual good hands make more money.
