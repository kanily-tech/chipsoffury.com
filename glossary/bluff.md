term: Bluff
---

Betting or raising with a weak hand, hoping your opponent will fold a better hand.

**Example:** You have 6♠ 7♠ on a board of A♣ K♥ 8♦ 2♠ 3♣. You have nothing — but you bet big, representing that you have an ace. If your opponent folds their pocket jacks, you win with the worst hand.

**Why bluffs work:**
- Opponents can't see your cards
- Betting represents strength
- Risk-averse players fold marginal hands

**When to bluff:**
- Against tight players who can fold
- When the board favors your range
- With backdoor equity (some chance to improve if called)
- When your story is consistent

**When NOT to bluff:**
- Against calling stations (they don't fold)
- Multi-way pots (someone likely has something)
- When you've been caught bluffing recently

**Beginner advice:** Bluff less than you think. Most low-stakes players call too much. Your strong hands are where the real money comes from.
