term: The Nuts
---

The best possible hand at any given moment, based on the community cards showing.

For example, if the board is **A♠ K♠ Q♠ 7♥ 2♣**, the nuts would be **J♠ T♠** (a royal flush). No other hand can beat it.

The nuts changes as new cards are dealt:
- On the flop, one hand might be the nuts
- By the river, a completely different hand could be unbeatable

When someone says "I had the nuts," they mean they held the absolute best hand possible — not just a strong hand, but one that *cannot* be beaten given the board.
