term: The Nuts
---

The best possible hand you can make with the cards on the table.

For example, if the board is **A♠ K♠ Q♠ 7♥ 2♣**, the nuts is **J♠ T♠** (a royal flush). Nothing beats it.

The nuts changes as new cards come out:
- On the flop, you might have the nuts
- By the river, a different hand could be unbeatable instead

When someone says "I had the nuts," they had the single best hand possible at that moment. It's unbeatable.
