term: Turn

The fourth community card in Hold'em, dealt after the flop betting round.

**The sequence:**
1. Preflop → 2. Flop (3 cards) → 3. **Turn (4th card)** → 4. River (5th card)

**Why it matters:**
- Bets double on the turn (in limit games) or jump significantly (in no-limit)
- You've seen 6 of 7 cards now, so your hand's strength is pretty clear
- Chasing draws gets expensive when only one card is left
- Pots grow fast here

**Turn play:**
- **Made hands:** Keep betting for value and don't back down
- **Draws:** Check your pot odds again with only one card left (multiply outs by 2, not 4)
- **Marginal hands:** Think about pot control - check to keep the river cheap

**Common mistakes on the turn:**
- Calling too much with draws (the math shifts dramatically with one card left)
- Folding value bets because the turn card looks threatening
- Missing how the turn card changes what hands your opponent could have
