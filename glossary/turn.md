term: Turn

The fourth community card in Hold'em — dealt after the flop betting round completes.

**The sequence:**
1. Preflop → 2. Flop (3 cards) → 3. **Turn (4th card)** → 4. River (5th card)

**Why the turn matters:**
- Bets typically double on the turn (in limit games) or increase significantly (in no-limit)
- You've now seen 6 of 7 cards — your hand's potential is nearly determined
- Drawing hands get more expensive to chase (only one card left)
- Big pots start building here

**Turn strategy:**
- **Made hands:** Keep betting for value; don't slow down
- **Draws:** Reassess pot odds with only one card to come (multiply outs by 2, not 4)
- **Marginal hands:** Consider pot control — check to see a cheap river

**Common turn mistakes:**
- Calling too much with draws (the math changes dramatically with one card left)
- Giving up on value bets when the turn "looks scary"
- Ignoring what the turn card does to opponent ranges
