term: Flush Draw
---

You've got four cards of the same suit and need one more to make a flush.

**Example:** You hold A♠ 7♠ and the flop comes K♠ 9♠ 3♥. That's four spades - one more and you've got a flush.

**The numbers:**
- 13 cards of each suit, minus the 4 you've seen = 9 outs
- About 18% chance to hit on the turn
- About 35% chance to hit by the river

Flush draws work great for semi-bluffs because you've got multiple ways to win. If everyone folds, you take the pot right there. If someone calls, you've still got a decent shot. And when you do hit, you're often holding the winner.

The best flush draw is one to the **ace** (a nut flush draw) since no one can beat you with a higher flush once you make it.
