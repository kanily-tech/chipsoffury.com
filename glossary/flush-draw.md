term: Flush Draw
---

A hand with four cards of the same suit, needing one more to complete a flush.

**Example:** You hold A♠ 7♠ and the flop is K♠ 9♠ 3♥. You have four spades and need one more.

**The math:**
- 13 cards of each suit, minus the 4 you see = **9 outs**
- ~18% chance to hit on the turn
- ~35% chance to hit by the river (if you see both cards)

Flush draws are strong semi-bluffing hands because:
1. You can win immediately if opponents fold
2. You have good equity if called
3. When you hit, you often have the best hand

A flush draw to the **ace** (nut flush draw) is especially valuable since you can't be beaten by a higher flush.
