term: Flop
---

The first three community cards dealt face-up in Hold'em. Everyone at the table can use them in their hand.

**How it fits into the game:**
1. **Preflop** - betting before any community cards
2. **Flop** - three cards come out, then everyone bets
3. **Turn** - the fourth card comes, more betting
4. **River** - the fifth and final card, last bet

**Why it matters:**
- You now see 5 of 7 cards (71% of your hand is done)
- Most of the time you'll know whether you're winning or losing by the flop
- This is when the pot usually gets fought over

**Types of flops:**
- **Dry flop:** Not many ways for people to make hands (like A♠ 7♥ 2♣)
- **Wet flop:** Lots of possible draws and made hands (like 9♠ 8♠ 7♥)
- **Coordinated flop:** The cards work together nicely (like J♦ T♦ 9♣)
- **Rainbow:** Three different suits, so nobody can make a flush yet

**"Flopping" a hand** means you made that hand on the flop. For example, "I flopped a set" means your pair in your hand made three of a kind when those three cards hit.
