term: Flop
---

The first three community cards dealt face-up in Hold'em, shared by all players.

**The sequence:**
1. **Preflop** — betting before any community cards
2. **Flop** — three cards dealt, then betting
3. **Turn** — fourth card dealt, then betting
4. **River** — fifth card dealt, final betting

**Why the flop matters:**
- You see 5 of 7 total cards (71% of your final hand)
- Most hands are made or missed on the flop
- Flop betting often determines who wins the pot

**Common flop descriptions:**
- **Dry flop:** Few draws possible (e.g., A♠ 7♥ 2♣)
- **Wet flop:** Many draws possible (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♥)
- **Coordinated flop:** Cards that connect well (e.g., J♦ T♦ 9♣)
- **Rainbow:** Three different suits (no flush draws)

**"Flopping" a hand** means making that hand on the flop (e.g., "I flopped a set" means your pocket pair hit three of a kind with the first three community cards).
