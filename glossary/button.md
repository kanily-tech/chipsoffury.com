term: Button
---

The dealer position, marked by a white disc. It's the best seat at the table because you act last on every street after the flop.

**Why it matters:**
- You see what everyone else does before you decide
- You control the pot size
- Bluffs work better from here

**How to play it:**
- Open a wider range of hands from the button
- Raise to steal the blinds when the action folds to you
- Use your position to push opponents around postflop

**How it rotates:**
The button moves one seat clockwise after each hand, so everyone eventually pays the blinds and gets the button the same number of times.

In home games, the button player deals the cards. In casinos, a dealer does the dealing, but the button still shows whose turn it is to be in that seat.
