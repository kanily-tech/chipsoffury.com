term: Button
---

The dealer position — marked by a white disc (the "button") and the best seat at the table.

**Why the button is best:**
- You act **last** on every street after the flop
- You see what everyone else does before you decide
- You control the pot size
- Bluffs are more effective from position

**Button strategy:**
- Play the widest range of hands from this position
- Raise to steal the blinds when it folds to you
- Take advantage of position to outmaneuver opponents postflop

**The rotation:**
The button moves one seat clockwise after each hand. This ensures everyone pays the blinds equally and gets the button equally over time.

In home games, the button player may actually deal. In casinos, a professional dealer handles the cards, but the button still marks whose "turn" it is to be in that seat.
