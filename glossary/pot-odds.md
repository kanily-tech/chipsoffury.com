term: Pot Odds
---

The ratio between what's in the pot and what you have to pay to stay in the hand.

**Example:** The pot is $100 and your opponent bets $20. You're looking at $120 in the pot and need $20 to call. That's 6:1 pot odds - meaning you get 6 dollars back for every dollar you put in.

**Why it matters:**
- Match pot odds against your chances of winning
- If you'll win more often than the pot odds suggest, call it
- If you'll win less often, fold

Pot odds turn "should I call?" into math. You're not guessing anymore - you're deciding based on numbers.
