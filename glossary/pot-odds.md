term: Pot Odds
---

The ratio between the current size of the pot and the cost of a call.

**Example:** The pot is $100 and your opponent bets $20. The pot is now $120, and you need $20 to call. That's 6:1 pot odds (or about 14% to break even).

**Why it matters:**
- Compare pot odds to your chance of winning
- If your winning percentage exceeds the break-even percentage, calling is profitable
- If it's lower, fold

Pot odds are the foundation of poker math — they turn "should I call?" from a guess into a calculation.
