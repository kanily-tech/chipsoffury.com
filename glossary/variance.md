term: Variance
---

The natural ups and downs in your results caused by luck, even when you play correctly.

In poker, skill determines long-term results, but short-term outcomes can swing wildly. You can make perfect decisions and still lose for days or weeks. That's variance.

**Key points:**
- High variance = bigger swings (common in tournaments and aggressive styles)
- Low variance = steadier results (common in tight, grinding strategies)
- Variance evens out over thousands of hands, not dozens

Understanding variance helps you:
- Not overreact to short-term losses
- Properly size your bankroll to survive downswings
- Judge your play by decisions, not results
