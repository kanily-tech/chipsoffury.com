term: Variance
---

The natural ups and downs in your results caused by luck, even when you play correctly.

In poker, skill wins over the long haul, but in the short term results bounce around. You can make the right call and still lose for days or weeks. That's variance.

**What it looks like:**
- High variance = wilder swings (common in tournaments and aggressive play)
- Low variance = steadier results (common in tight grinding strategies)
- Variance smooths out over thousands of hands, not dozens

Why it matters:
- Don't panic over short-term losses
- Size your bankroll big enough to weather downswings
- Judge yourself by the decisions you made, not what happened
