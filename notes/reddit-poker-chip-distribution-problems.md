## Problem Clusters (Across 28 Threads)

- Denomination mapping confusion (`~20/28`):
  - New hosts do not know which values to assign to colors/unlabeled chips.
  - Common over-complication: too many close denominations or weird nonstandard ladders.
- Chip inventory mismatch (`~17/28`):
  - Retail sets often include too many high-denomination chips and too few low chips.
  - 300-chip sets are frequently too tight for 8-12 players plus rebuys.
- Blind structure vs session length mismatch (`~16/28`):
  - Players want 3-4 hour games, but blind schedules are chosen ad hoc.
  - Fast increases produce shove-heavy games with limited postflop play.
- Cash vs tournament model confusion (`~12/28`):
  - Hosts blend cash and tournament assumptions (rebuys, chip values, blind increases).
  - Buy-in mapping and payout logic becomes inconsistent.
- Change-making and color-up friction (`~11/28`):
  - Lack of denomination spacing causes frequent breaks for change.
  - No clear race-off/color-up plan leads to table clutter and counting errors.
- First-time host operational gaps (`~10/28`):
  - Last-minute setup requests and no default template.
  - Unclear rules on rebuys/add-ons and when to adjust structure mid-game.

## Raw Notes

- Most threads are not about advanced strategy; they are operational setup problems for amateur home hosts.
- The same three variables recur in nearly every post: `players`, `total chips`, and `target duration`.
- Advice quality in comments is inconsistent, suggesting demand for a canonical calculator/template.

# Chip Distribution Tool Fit Analysis (Internal)

Date: 2026-02-11  
Source: `notes/reddit-poker-chip-distribution-problems.md` (28-thread Reddit synthesis)  
Target page reviewed: `tools/chip-distribution-calculator.md`

## What The Current Tool Solves Well

- Denomination mapping confusion:
  - Suggests a conventional denomination ladder for unmarked chip sets.
- Chip inventory mismatch:
  - Uses actual chip counts and warns when exact buy-ins are impossible.
- Blind/chip incompatibility:
  - Flags when smallest chip is larger than the small blind.
- Too-shallow chip stacks:
  - Warns when chips per player are too low for smooth betting flow.
- Setup alignment:
  - Shareable URL helps hosts sync on blinds, values, players, and chip set.

## What It Only Partially Solves

- First-time host setup:
  - Wizard helps, but there are no one-click defaults by player count + session goals.
- Change friction:
  - Better mapping reduces it, but there is no explicit change-making guidance.

## High-Impact Gaps To Improve

- Tournament mode:
  - No blind schedule builder, starting stack tuner, or duration targeting.
- Color-up/race-off planning:
  - No plan for removing low chips as structure progresses.
- Rebuy/add-on logic:
  - No structured support for rebuy windows/add-ons.
- Cash vs tournament guardrails:
  - No explicit mode separation to prevent mixed-rule setups.
- Template presets:
  - Missing quick presets like `8 players`, `3-4 hours`, `$20 buy-in`.
