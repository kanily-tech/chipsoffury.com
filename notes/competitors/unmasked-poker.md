- **Browser Dependency**: Requires modern web browser with webcam/headset; no native app optimization[1][5]
- **Streamlined Features**: Intentionally simple feature set means fewer advanced customization and management options compared to heavy club-oriented apps[1][5]

### 8. Quick Comparison Notes
- **vs. Poker Now**: Unmasked emphasizes built-in video and social presence more than clubs or advanced history tools; Poker Now offers more extensive hand history and replay features[1][4]
- **vs. Native Apps**: Trades elaborate graphics and native app performance for simplicity, instant accessibility, and integrated video without downloads[1][5]
- **vs. Real Money Platforms**: Focuses on social play experience rather than competitive poker or real money gaming[1][5]
- **vs. PokerStars Home Games**: More streamlined and immediate setup, but lacks the polish and extensive features of established poker platforms[1][5]
