- **Best For**: Home games that want either a full virtual table or just digital chip tracking alongside physical cards[1][5]
- **Cost to Host**: Free base app with optional PRO subscription ($3.99/month or $24.99/year) that unlocks poker mode, voice chat, and bomb pots. Free version includes 30-minute trial of PRO features per game and unlimited chips-only mode.[2][6][7]

Supports 15+ poker variants including Texas Hold'em, Omaha (Hi, Hi-Lo, 3/5/6 Card), Pineapple variants (Regular, Crazy, Lazy), Short Deck, Double Board Hold'em, Irish Poker, Watermelon, Super Hold'em, and Courchevel.[2][5][6]
- **Chips Only Mode**: Digital chip counter for live, in‑person games with physical cards and dealers. Players use their phones to check, bet, raise, or fold while the app tracks chip stacks, blinds, antes, and side pots automatically.[5][6][8]
- **Advanced Features**: Bomb pots (randomly triggered super-sized pots), Run-it-Twice/Thrice (multiple board runouts), Rabbit Hunting, Variation Roulette (random game selection), Dealer's Choice (button player selects variant), integrated voice chat, customizable blinds and timers, and detailed profit/performance graphs.[2][5][6][8]

- **Developer Tips**: Optional in-app tips ranging from $0.99 to $4.99 to support the developers.[2]
- **No In-App Chip Store**: No virtual currency purchases or chip packages; focus is on utility and flexibility for home games rather than monetization through chip sales.[1][7]

### 4. Pros
- Extremely flexible: can function as a full online table or as a companion tool for live games, which is rare among poker apps.[1][5]
- Works across all platforms: iOS native app, Android native app, and responsive web client, making it easy to use wherever your group plays and on any device.[1][2][3][4]
- No sign-up required for basic use, allowing for quick game setup with just a game code.[8][9]
- Generous 30-minute trial of PRO features in every game session, letting users test premium functionality before subscribing.[7]
- Supports up to 10 players per table with ad-free experience.[8]
- Wide variety of poker variants (15+) including exotic games rarely found in other apps.[2][5][6]

### 5. Cons
- Less focused on persistent online clubs; oriented more around sessions and tournaments than long‑term club ecosystems.[5]
- Full poker mode with guided betting rounds requires PRO subscription after 30-minute trial, whereas chips-only mode remains free indefinitely.[2][7]
- Voice chat and bomb pots are locked behind the PRO subscription paywall.[2][6]

### 6. Security & Fairness
- As a virtual table and chip tracker designed for private home games, fairness is based on trust among known players rather than algorithmic RNG certification.[5]
- Web client uses modern HTTPS, and native apps are distributed via official App Store and Google Play Store channels, with regular updates and version tracking.[1][3][4][10]
- Account credentials are user-managed with standard security practices; users are responsible for maintaining account confidentiality.[9]
- Developed by Kanily Technologies LLP, with Terms of Service and Privacy Policy available on the website.[1][9]

### 7. Best Suited For
- Groups that already meet in person and want a robust chip-tracking solution for live games with physical cards.[1][5][8]
- Home game organizers who want to run full virtual poker tables with automated dealing and multiple poker variants.[1][2][5]
- Organizers who run mixed live/online series and need the same tool to support both modes of play.[1]
- Players who want to try poker mode features before committing to a subscription, thanks to the 30-minute trial per game.[7]
- Groups looking for an ad-free, no-registration-required poker solution that works across all devices (iOS, Android, web).[1][2][3][4][8]

### 8. Quick Comparison Notes
- Compared to ClubGG or PPPoker, Chips of Fury is less about large online clubs and more about supporting home-game logistics and hybrid setups.[5][1]
- Compared to Poker Now and Unmasked, it uniquely covers "chips-only" live mode, making it a strong companion for real-world games with physical cards.[5][8]
- Unlike most poker apps, Chips of Fury offers true cross-platform support with native iOS and Android apps plus web access, rather than being limited to web-only or single-platform solutions.[1][2][3][4]
- The freemium model with 30-minute PRO trials per game allows groups to test advanced features regularly without commitment, unlike apps that require upfront subscriptions.[7]
