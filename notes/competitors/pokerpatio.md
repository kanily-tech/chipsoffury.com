## Product Description

Poker Patio is a free online poker platform designed to make online poker simple and fun for everyone. Their mission is
to become an all-encompassing destination for free poker - similar to what chess.com is for chess. The platform
prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, guided by the design principle: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

**Key differentiator:** Purely web-based with no app download required. No registration needed to start playing
immediately.

## Platforms

- **Web Browser** - Primary platform, works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **No iOS App** - Not available on Apple App Store
- **No Android App** - Not available on Google Play Store

This is a significant differentiator from Chips of Fury - Poker Patio has no native mobile apps, limiting app store
discoverability but eliminating download friction.
