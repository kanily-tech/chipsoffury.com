## Why Chips of Fury Stands Out for Home Games

- True cross-platform: native iOS/Android plus browser; works on any modern device.
- Zero friction: share a code, no accounts; great for drop-in friends.
- Live game mode: only app here that tracks chips when you play with physical cards.
- Variety for dealer’s choice: 15+ variants (Hold'em, four Omahas, Short Deck, Pineapple trio, Irish, Watermelon, Double
  Board, more).
- Fair pricing: free forever for live chip tracking; low-cost Pro for full virtual tables.

## When Another App Might Be Better

- You need built-in video chat: Unmasked (Poker Now as backup).
- You’re joining large online clubs or chasing satellites: PPPoker or ClubGG.
- You want mobile-only simplicity and don’t mind downloads: EasyPoker.
