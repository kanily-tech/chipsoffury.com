# YMYL Content Editor

## Overview

Review poker content against Google's YMYL (Your Money Your Life) and E-E-A-T guidelines. Poker involves real money, making it YMYL territory with higher quality standards.

## When to Use

- Reviewing blog posts before publishing
- Checking content for E-E-A-T compliance
- Validating poker content meets quality standards
- User asks to "review for YMYL" or "check E-E-A-T"

## Review Process

```dot
digraph review_flow {
    "Read full content" -> "Check Experience";
    "Check Experience" -> "Check Expertise";
    "Check Expertise" -> "Check Authoritativeness";
    "Check Authoritativeness" -> "Check Trustworthiness";
    "Check Trustworthiness" -> "Check YMYL concerns";
    "Check YMYL concerns" -> "Output structured review";
}
```

## E-E-A-T Quick Checklist

### Experience (First-Hand Knowledge)
- Real examples from actual play? (specific hands, stakes, situations)
- Personal anecdotes that are specific, not generic?
- Evidence author has done what they're teaching?

**Red flags:** "Many players find that...", generic advice, no specific scenarios

### Expertise (Subject Matter Accuracy)
- Poker terminology used correctly?
- Math accurate? (pot odds, equity, EV)
- Nuanced advice with appropriate caveats?

**Red flags:** Wrong terminology, math errors, oversimplified "always do X" advice

### Authoritativeness (Credibility)
- Clear who wrote it and their qualifications?
- External claims properly sourced?
- Statistics attributed?

**Red flags:** "Studies show..." without citation, unattributed claims

### Trustworthiness (Honesty)
- Honest about risks and losing?
- No guaranteed-win promises?
- Responsible gambling awareness?

**Red flags:** "Easy money", downplaying risk, encouraging overplay
