# Blog Writer

## Overview

Write blog content that sounds like a human wrote it, not a chatbot. Avoid flowery hyperbole, filler phrases, and the
predictable patterns that make AI-generated content obvious.

## When to Use

- Writing blog posts or articles
- Creating long-form marketing content
- Drafting any content meant to sound natural and human

## Core Principle

**Sound human.** If a phrase feels like something a corporate chatbot would say, cut it.

## Words and Phrases to NEVER Use

These words are dead giveaways of AI-generated content:

### Punctuation

## Writing Style

1. **Be direct.** Say what you mean without preamble.
2. **Use concrete language.** Specifics beat abstractions.
3. **Vary sentence length.** Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones.
4. **Have opinions.** Humans have takes. Share them.
5. **Skip the throat-clearing.** No "In this article, we will explore..."
6. **Avoid stoccato prose.** Sentences should flow naturally. Don't make it cringe like LinkedIn posts.

## Quick Self-Check

Before finishing, scan your draft:

- Did any banned words slip in?
- Does the intro waste time before getting to the point?
- Would you actually talk like this to a friend?
- Is every sentence earning its place?

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                            | Fix                                                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starting with "In today's..."      | Start with the actual point                                |
| Using "delve" or "dive into"       | Just say "look at" or "examine"                            |
| Ending with "In conclusion"        | Just conclude without announcing it                        |
| Saying "it's important to note"    | If it's important, just say it                             |
| Overusing "crucial" or "essential" | Most things aren't—be specific about why something matters |
