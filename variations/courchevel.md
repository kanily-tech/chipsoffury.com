## What is Courchevel Poker?

Courchevel is an exciting variant of 5-card Omaha that adds a unique strategic element: **the first flop card is dealt face-up before the pre-flop betting round begins**. This exposed card dramatically changes pre-flop strategy and hand selection, making it one of the most intriguing poker variations available.

Named after the prestigious French ski resort, Courchevel brings a sophisticated twist to traditional Omaha gameplay. The exposed card provides crucial information that affects betting decisions right from the start, creating deeper strategic considerations than standard Omaha variants.

## How to Play Courchevel

### The Deal

1. Each player receives **5 hole cards** face down
2. **Before any betting**, the first flop card is dealt face-up in the center
3. Pre-flop betting begins with this card already visible
4. After pre-flop betting, the remaining two flop cards are dealt
5. Turn and river proceed as normal

### Hand Requirements

Like all Omaha variants, you **must use exactly 2 of your 5 hole cards** combined with **exactly 3 community cards** to make your hand. This rule is strictly enforced - you cannot use more or fewer hole cards, regardless of what would make the best hand.

### The Power of the Exposed Card

The exposed flop card fundamentally changes pre-flop dynamics:
- **Flush draws** become immediately apparent when a suited card appears
- **Straight possibilities** are easier to evaluate
- **Set potential** increases in value with a low exposed card
- **Betting ranges** tighten or loosen based on the exposed card

## Strategy Tips for Courchevel

### Pre-Flop Adjustments

The exposed card should significantly influence your starting hand selection:

- **Paired exposed card**: Increases the value of pocket pairs and trips
- **Suited exposed card**: Premium suited holdings become more valuable
- **Connected exposed card**: Straight draws gain immediate potential
- **High exposed card**: Big pairs and high card hands increase in value

### Position Matters More

Position becomes even more critical in Courchevel because:
- Late position players can better gauge opponents' interest in the exposed card
- The exposed card creates more defined betting patterns
- Bluffing opportunities increase when the exposed card doesn't help typical starting hands

### Hand Reading

The exposed card provides a wealth of information for hand reading:
- Heavy action with a suited exposed card often indicates flush draws
- Aggressive betting with a paired board suggests sets or full house potential
- Cautious play might indicate the exposed card hurt opponents' ranges

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Overvaluing the Exposed Card

While the exposed card provides information, remember:
- You still need a complete 5-card hand to win
- Two more flop cards can completely change the board texture
- Don't commit too heavily based on one card alone

### Ignoring Omaha Fundamentals

The basic principles of Omaha still apply:
- Look for connected, suited starting hands
- Multiple draw potential is crucial
- Nut potential matters more than in Hold'em

### Playing Too Many Hands

The exposed card might seem to "hit" your hand, but discipline remains key:
- Stick to premium starting hands
- Don't chase marginal draws
- Position and stack sizes still matter
