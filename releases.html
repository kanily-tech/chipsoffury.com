<ul role="list">

  <p>
    <strong>🔴 Ante support</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also known as 'boot' in some games, ante is a fixed bet that every player has to put in at the
    beginning of the hand to participate in the hand
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>🔮 Play preemptive turns</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you can pre-play a turn when you are waiting for your turn to bet. These will show as
    dotted border action buttons. Options are -
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check / Fold</li>
    <li>Check</li>
    <li>Call [x]</li>
    <li>Call any</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

    <strong>📈 Stack and Win/Loss Visualizations</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Tapping any player on the table will bring up a menu. Select Statistics to see
    cool new interactive charts!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pinch and drag to zoom and pan
    </li>
    <li>
      Long press to select a particular hand and see hand summary
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>💸 Self loading wallets</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a new option that you can enable during game configuration. This will
    automatically credit players with chips when they try to buy-in.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, even if the player's wallet has insufficient chips, they will be able
    to buy-in with any amount - their wallet will be filled automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is to reduce admin's work. Admin does not have to worry about chip
    distribution in trusted groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>👩🏽‍🏫 Hand rank assistance (during hand)</strong>
  </p>

  <h5>समय, وقت, Tempo, время, Zeit</h5>
  <p>
    Time is ever moving forward<br>

    The admin can now pause time<br>

<release-notes
        version="v5.2.0"
        release_date="July 9, 2023"
        apk_url="">
  <p>
    This release brings a major change in how chips are distributed. This is an attempt to simplify the
    flow from joining a game to buy-in
  </p>
  <ul style="font-style: italic;">
    Till the previous version
    <li>A player joined the game room using a code</li>
    <li>Then to obtain chips they had to buy chips</li>
    <li>The admin had to approve this request</li>
    <li>The chips were credited to the player's wallet</li>
    <li>Finally the player could proceed to buy-in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>👮 Now, only Admin can give (and take back!) chips</strong>
  <p>
  <p>
    For a non-admin player joining the game, the flow will look like this
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A player joins the game room using a code</li>
    <li>The admin will credit chips to the player's wallet</li>
    <li>The player can now buy-in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This means the admin has to do a bit more work. But it can be reduced by using the auto-credit chips
    setting in the game config
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>💰 Improved auto-credit behaviour</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time of approving a join request, the admin will now also get an option to disable the auto-credit
    for that particular player
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>🫶 Quality of life UI/UX improvements</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved Hand Guide</li>
    <li>Fixed Chat Page layout bug that was causing the chat input to get hidden by keyboard</li>
    <li>Cleaner layout for the table summary in the room</li>
    <li>Tapping on chat log in the game screen will now open up the dedicated chat page</li>
  </ul>
</release-notes>
