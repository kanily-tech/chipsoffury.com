        <h1>Android APK Releases - Chips of Fury</h1>
        <p class="date_right">Last updated: October 16, 2023</p>
        <p>
          You can directly download the Android APK if you do not have access to Google Play Store
          on your device. Some important notes:
        </p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            <h4>
              You will need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings.
            </h4>
            Android will most likely prompt you for that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>You will not receive automatic updates.</h4>
          </li>

          <p>
            <strong>‚è≥ More love for structured blinds</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cleaner UX to create structured blinds</li>
            <li>Blinds structures can increase based on time, or number of hands</li>
            <li>Bug fixes to prevent incorrect blind levels because of an unexpected game server crash</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>üî¥ Ante support</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Also known as 'boot' in some games, ante is a fixed bet that every player has to put in at the
            beginning of the hand to participate in the hand
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>üîÆ Play preemptive turns</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you can pre-play a turn when you are waiting for your turn to bet. These will show as
            dotted border action buttons. Options are -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check / Fold</li>
            <li>Check</li>
            <li>Call [x]</li>
            <li>Call any</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo support! (in chips only mode)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Admin can undo upto 10 previous turns. This is useful to fix any incorrect betting, by mistake or
            otherwise. It can also be used to fix incorrect settlements!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>ü´∂ Quality of life improvements</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sit out and leave table work during a paused game
            </li>
            <li>
              Faster game load time

            <strong>üìà Stack and Win/Loss Visualizations</strong>

          <p>
            Tapping any player on the table will bring up a menu. Select Statistics to see
            cool new interactive charts!

            <strong>üí∏ Self loading wallets</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a new option that you can enable during game configuration. This will
            automatically credit players with chips when they try to buy-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, even if the player's wallet has insufficient chips, they will be able
            to buy-in with any amount - their wallet will be filled automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is to reduce admin's work. Admin does not have to worry about chip
            distribution in trusted groups.

                release_date="July 9, 2023"
                apk_url="https://cof-assets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/releases/android/cof-release-v5.2.0_62.apk">
          <p>
            This release brings a major change in how chips are distributed. This is an attempt to simplify the
            flow from joining a game to buy-in
          </p>
          <ul style="font-style: italic;">
            Till the previous version
            <li>A player joined the game room using a code</li>
            <li>Then to obtain chips they had to buy chips</li>
            <li>The admin had to approve this request</li>
            <li>The chips were credited to the player's wallet</li>
            <li>Finally the player could proceed to buy-in</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>üëÆ Now, only Admin can give (and take back!) chips</strong>
          <p>
          <p>
            For a non-admin player joining the game, the flow will look like this
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A player joins the game room using a code</li>
            <li>The admin will credit chips to the player's wallet</li>
            <li>The player can now buy-in</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This means the admin has to do a bit more work. But it can be reduced by using the auto-credit chips
            setting in the game config
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>üí∞ Improved auto-credit behaviour</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of approving a join request, the admin will now also get an option to disable the auto-credit
            for that particular player
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>ü´∂ Quality of life UI/UX improvements</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved Hand Guide</li>
            <li>Fixed Chat Page layout bug that was causing the chat input to get hidden by keyboard</li>
            <li>Cleaner layout for the table summary in the room</li>
            <li>Tapping on chat log in the game screen will now open up the dedicated chat page</li>
          </ul>
