          <h1>Android APK Releases - Chips of Fury</h1>
          <p class="date_right">Last updated: August 4, 2023</p>
          <p>
            You can directly download the Android APK if you do not have access to Google Play Store
            on your device. Some important notes:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <h4>
                You will need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings.
              </h4>
              Android will most likely prompt you for that.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>You will not receive automatic updates.</h4>
            </li>
            <li>
              This section is not actively updated. Please check
              the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipsoffury.chipsoffury">Google Play Store</a>
              for the latest version. If you do not find the latest version here as an APK, please contact
              us at <a href="mailto:hi.kanily@gmail.com">hi.kanily@gmail.com</a> and we will try to make it available.

              Tapping any player on the table will bring up a menu. Select Statistics to see
              cool new interactive charts!

            <p>
              This is a new option that you can enable during game configuration. This will
              automatically credit players with chips when they try to buy-in.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, even if the player's wallet has insufficient chips, they will be able
              to buy-in with any amount - their wallet will be filled automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is to reduce admin's work. Admin does not have to worry about chip
              distribution in trusted groups.

            <p>
              This release brings a major change in how chips are distributed. This is an attempt to simplify the
              flow from joining a game to buy-in
            </p>
            <ul style="font-style: italic;">
              Till the previous version
              <li>A player joined the game room using a code</li>
              <li>Then to obtain chips they had to buy chips</li>
              <li>The admin had to approve this request</li>
              <li>The chips were credited to the player's wallet</li>
              <li>Finally the player could proceed to buy-in</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>üëÆ Now, only Admin can give (and take back!) chips</strong>
            <p>
            <p>
              For a non-admin player joining the game, the flow will look like this
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A player joins the game room using a code</li>
              <li>The admin will credit chips to the player's wallet</li>
              <li>The player can now buy-in</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This means the admin has to do a bit more work. But it can be reduced by using the auto-credit chips
              setting in the game config
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üí∞ Improved auto-credit behaviour</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time of approving a join request, the admin will now also get an option to disable the auto-credit
              for that particular player
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ü´∂ Quality of life UI/UX improvements</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improved Hand Guide</li>
              <li>Fixed Chat Page layout bug that was causing the chat input to get hidden by keyboard</li>
              <li>Cleaner layout for the table summary in the room</li>
              <li>Tapping on chat log in the game screen will now open up the dedicated chat page</li>
            </ul>
