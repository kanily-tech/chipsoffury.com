    <strong>Chips of Fury: the 'We Gotta Eat Too' update</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember when they said 'nothing in life is free'? Well, our server bills agree. Starting with this update, we're introducing our PRO plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's how it works: you can try all premium features for free during the first <code>30</code> minutes of each game. After that, you can continue playing the basic game for free, or upgrade to PRO to keep access to all features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real talk? We're a bit nervous about this change. But between keeping the lights on and keeping the game running smoothly, we had to make this move sooner or later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your support means the world to us (and our landlords). This update is stacked with features, so if you spot any bugs trying to bluff their way in, give us a shout. We'll be fully focused on ensuring a smooth experience for everyone in the coming days.
  </p>

  <div style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px 10px 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px">
  <p>
    Note: Paid plans are not available on the web and android APK yet, please download the app from play store or app store to purchase. After that
    you can continue using the app on any platform.

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>🔮 Play preemptive turns</strong>

    <strong>💸 Self loading wallets</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a new option that you can enable during game configuration. This will
    automatically credit players with chips when they try to buy-in.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, even if the player's wallet has insufficient chips, they will be able
    to buy-in with any amount - their wallet will be filled automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is to reduce admin's work. Admin does not have to worry about chip
    distribution in trusted groups.

        release_date="July 9, 2023"
        apk_url="">
  <p>
    This release brings a major change in how chips are distributed. This is an attempt to simplify the
    flow from joining a game to buy-in
  </p>
  <ul style="font-style: italic;">
    Till the previous version
    <li>A player joined the game room using a code</li>
    <li>Then to obtain chips they had to buy chips</li>
    <li>The admin had to approve this request</li>
    <li>The chips were credited to the player's wallet</li>
    <li>Finally the player could proceed to buy-in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>👮 Now, only Admin can give (and take back!) chips</strong>
  <p>
  <p>
    For a non-admin player joining the game, the flow will look like this
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A player joins the game room using a code</li>
    <li>The admin will credit chips to the player's wallet</li>
    <li>The player can now buy-in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This means the admin has to do a bit more work. But it can be reduced by using the auto-credit chips
    setting in the game config
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>💰 Improved auto-credit behaviour</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time of approving a join request, the admin will now also get an option to disable the auto-credit
    for that particular player
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>🫶 Quality of life UI/UX improvements</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved Hand Guide</li>
    <li>Fixed Chat Page layout bug that was causing the chat input to get hidden by keyboard</li>
    <li>Cleaner layout for the table summary in the room</li>
    <li>Tapping on chat log in the game screen will now open up the dedicated chat page</li>
